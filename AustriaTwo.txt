0:00
as you interviewing as you can see Seline I am sharing my screen and this
0:05
is in the past this is uh fall 1902 where we left off last time and instead
0:13
of like asking you your thoughts on the current board state we're going to be doing that but for on a season by season
0:20
basis okay so why don't we start off right now with your whole situation
0:26
going on with Turkey Russia and yourself here it seems like this was a blunder
0:34
what exactly happened here can you explain please
0:40
that was the round that we support held Wait is this when we support held
0:46
um Romania yes yes that was a bun that was a
0:52
mistake i wrote support hold i meant to do support move like Wait hold on are
0:58
you looking at my screen i'm sharing it right now sorry is it too small i'm really sorry
1:04
hold on i I can control and then use the scroll wheel to scroll in or out this
1:11
was in the past this was when you just supported him into rum and you were
1:16
trying to protect it from the Russians at first turkey here is inside Romania
1:25
i Yeah hold on i think I Are we hold on go ahead and say what you're going to
1:31
say i kind of interrupted no yeah i was going to say this this then in that case we were wrong this was not the
1:37
blunderous round on our part we did want to support um
1:43
Turkey i'm not sure why we didn't use Budapest though
1:48
yeah we meant to support Turkey and the move into Bulgaria was a tur was
1:55
that something Turkey wanted or was that just like you stabbing that was that was
2:01
our attempt because we knew that we were safe in Greece um from Turkey and Italy
2:08
well if we Sorry go on i was just going to say we just wanted to move into a
2:14
more tactical position than Greece where we knew that we weren't going to be doing anything with it there was that
2:21
Well I find it very fascinating that you chose to support Romania but also move
2:27
into Bulgaria at the same time is there any reason why you decided to
2:33
do that oh yeah yeah like I said we wanted to strengthen our alliance with Turkey and
2:38
we wanted to prevent Russia from getting Romania um but at the same time we
2:44
didn't want to waste our fleet in Greece because we were we knew we were safe from Turkey so we wanted to move it into
2:50
a more battle ready position wait and moving into Bulgaria taking a Turkish
2:55
territory helped Turkey in the long run wait I mean they
3:04
like they they let you take Bulgaria as in like they were aware that you were going to take it yeah yeah interesting
3:11
okay okay i can see that Perky chose to hold Constantinople there so really is
3:19
all it really is their fault the other interesting thing about this moves move order here is is your start of moving
3:27
into the German centers which I mean if I if I recall from last time you weren't
3:34
looking to get into a conflict with Germany at that point what prompted you to move Vienna into Bohemia there i
3:42
think we kind of caught a whiff of Germany um becoming a little reluctant
3:47
to like be more active like I think they were starting to become less active so
3:53
then we're like "Okay we should take advantage of this because if they're not going to like if they're not going to go
3:59
full force then we should." And then that's a good point for us to get them while they're not really focused i see
4:06
exactly and also I think we began realizing I don't think we knew it this
4:12
early but eventually we began realizing Turkey is kind of a lost cause a little
4:17
bit like we kept trying to help them but it just like wasn't really going our way so
4:24
we started to realize like okay maybe if we can't get it there um then it makes
4:30
sense to move into Germany i see you need to have some some way of growth at some point exactly cuz at this point
4:38
this is like our I don't know it felt like every single round we had been fighting for Romania with Russia and it
4:43
was just going back and forth back and forth and it was like "Okay we're not getting anywhere here let's go somewhere else
4:49
interesting what What was your alliance with Turkey sorry not Turkey what was your alliance with Italy at this time i
4:57
see that you've held both in Budapest and Shist just by themselves is there any reason to do that yeah we aligned
5:05
with Italy pretty strongly so we were kind of like making excuses to the other countries like Russia and France being
5:12
like "Oh like we just we're focusing on you know Germany we're focusing on Turkey right now we don't want to attack
5:18
Italy especially since they're looking pretty good they have a lot of fleets like we don't want to like really mess with them at this point that's what we
5:24
told everyone but behind the scenes we had a strong alliance with them so we decided not to move into their
5:30
territories um because they were also planning to expand like westward anyway
5:35
so they weren't really looking to like take us down and we trusted them in that so we also didn't want to like attack
5:42
them yeah how about we move on to the next season here or the next this is the
5:48
build phase i mean it will be winter right yeah it's the build phase you decided to build an army in Vienna and I
5:54
don't think that is a very you know controversial move it's the only open space you had to build why not um at
6:02
this point what did you think that army was going to be used for primarily a defense against Russia or was it a
6:08
Germany like bound army at this point when we built it it was definitely uh
6:14
Russian defense um because at this point we were
6:19
more antagonistic towards Russia and not as focused on Germany but obviously as
6:26
you know now we ended up moving into Munich with that because we figured
6:31
Russia as it was was kind of retreating in that area specifically like more northern they were focusing a little bit
6:38
more on obtaining Turkey so we felt more safe um and that we could use Vienna to
6:46
move into Germany more effectively but yeah when we first constructed it it was
6:51
definitely more of like a like you said it was inevitable that it was going to be constructed there but our idea was it's like a fortifying a wall against
6:58
Russia we didn't plan to move it necessarily we were thinking of like oh maybe going to Galatia if Turkey moves
7:04
out of there but it was like a a last line of or a first line of defense okay
7:10
all right we'll move on to the spring phase of 1903 and here again in in Russia in
7:19
Turkey all that whole area like you said it seems like this whole back and forth this struggle for Romania and this is
7:26
also a very interesting point where you decide to support hold Romania instead
7:32
of supporting Galatia into Romania yes this was the fatal not so fatal mistake
7:38
yes this was the Yeah this was the slip up that actually ended up kind of gaining our favor or allowing us to
7:47
become a little stronger mhm how would Yeah yeah go ahead oh yes no how how how
7:54
is this so well you meant you meant to support Galatia and Tum yes how did that
8:00
mistake make you more powerful make you stronger because Russia thought we were
8:06
helping them in in um destroying Turkey because all along they were trying to
8:11
get us to just eliminate Turkey take them out you know like stop supporting them because they were dying anyway and
8:18
so this kind of looked like to them that we were helping them and like finally taking their advice and like destroying
8:23
Turkey that's why we kind of like tried to play it off as like being on purpose but really I remember when when the
8:30
order first went through a was like "Wait Gabe you you supported Romania." And I was like "Oh yeah yep I did." And
8:37
I should have friends with him and then he was like "Wait wait wait there was a mistake what was the mistake?" And I was like "No no no i was just double-ecking
8:43
that I was I was supporting you." So yeah I definitely was lying there
8:49
that was a mistake that wasn't on purpose nice information but it immediately made Adbe trust us more mhm
8:54
but the I think the evil upside also was that it ended up hurting Turkey of
9:01
course um but because it truly was a mistake they still trusted us and
9:06
instead of like when they eventually we'll get to this probably a little later but when they eventually were like "Okay fine we're we're out of it." You
9:13
know they decided to help us and not Russia i feel like if we had on purpose
9:18
backstabbed Turkey right then when they needed it most they would have been like very vengeful of us and helped Russia um
9:25
but that's not what happened if you did it was a win-win for us if you did support Galatia into Romania here
9:31
successfully do you think that Turkey would be in a much better position and could possibly still be alive or still
9:38
be in a fighting chance yeah I think they probably would have like had a
9:43
longer survival time but I don't really think that it would have helped them that much like just to be honest like
9:50
Russia was not going to stop like going after it so I think that even though like even if we helped them that round
9:56
like maybe they would have lasted like maybe a couple more rounds but I don't think it would have like helped them win the whole game or anything like that
10:02
yeah because even so they would have what they would have uh one troop in Romania and then the two fleets they
10:10
would still Yeah there was no way that they would be like that's a sustainable thing because there's nothing else for
10:15
them to capture there they would have to stay the same or shrink and Russia could just be piling on there so it would have
10:21
helped them hold out a little bit longer but I really don't see how it would have become anything but like a sunk cost for
10:28
both of us so there's another point of interest and area of it an area of
10:33
interest you could say and that would be with Italy over here where you guys both moved into Venice at the same time uh
10:40
can you please explain the uh the whole idea behind that that was Mac's plan
10:45
yeah go ahead yeah no Mac was like the mastermind behind this she was planning because um you know like Germany and No
10:53
not Germany france and Russia obviously were kind of the bigger dogs and they were kind of asking us kept on
11:01
questioning why we weren't going into Italy because obviously our proximity with them is very clear and also we have
11:07
a we have a port like right next to theirs that we could easily just and so it's we uh well Matt came up with
11:15
this idea to kind of avert that or divert that attention by us fakeely
11:21
invading their territory um and making it look like we're attacking them but
11:27
really what it is is just to divert their attention and allow them to gain or allow us to gain their trust so that
11:33
in the later rounds we can also gain their trust and then backstab them basically because we we are planning on
11:40
keeping our um partnership very strong well I find it very interesting how you
11:46
call it a like fake invasion cuz to like a trained uh diplomacy player like more
11:53
experienced um arrange bounces happen a lot in diplomacy like like the one that just
12:00
happened in spring in Venice so coming from like if France were more
12:06
experienced they would sniff the [ __ ] immediately but I think that
12:12
that sort of deceptive action is um very interesting and I think it's very smart
12:19
do you think that Do you think that this this uh whole trick worked that it fooled the intended targets yes um
12:27
obviously the Romania thing ate that up he loved it he was like we are good
12:32
friends now he totally believed it um and then the Venice thing it kind of I'm
12:38
not sure they fully bought it because they kept trying to dog us to go like "No go Venice go Venice go Venice go
12:43
Venice." Pretty much like they were fighting tooth and nail to support us
12:49
into Venice and get Venice out of Italy's hands but um I think we did it between this showing like okay we tried
12:55
but they they defended and then the next round where we were also like oh we could but we much rather would go for
13:02
Munich between those two I think they they were kind of like there we have enough plausible deniability that it's
13:09
believable you know yeah and because Sorry go ahead no no go ahead all right
13:15
all right all right all right all right so you So basically this turn it seems
13:20
like you are very much willing to be allies with Russia i mean that's what
13:25
your moves are like uh kind of suggesting but it's not what you guys are thinking do you think that there is
13:33
I mean like do you think that's a possibility you working with Russia here like in a more long-term alliance i
13:40
definitely think it is a possibility i think that there are no there's no permanent allies there's no permanent
13:47
enemies like every ally enemy every enemy can be an ally and I think at this point we're trying to get them to trust
13:53
us and like our moves can suggest that we're allies i don't think we'll ever really say it out loud and be like "Hey
14:00
we're aligned like we have with Italy but I think that we can make moves that kind of like present allyship which I'm
14:07
not opposed to." And I think eventually um that'll just help us kind of take them down though because we're getting
14:15
into their weak spots and getting them to trust us um but in the back of our minds we definitely are not planning to
14:22
like help them win yeah I think Russia is a little bit different from Italy i
14:27
think Italy is more trustworthy honestly because they
14:33
reached out to us right away and it is mutually advantageous for both of us um
14:38
so I think I do see a long-term alliance with Italy more than I do with Russia if
14:45
we are to ally with Russia I feel like it would not be so much a long-term
14:50
thing like it is with Italy right now it would be leaning more towards like oh just for this round you move into there
14:57
we'll move into there okay we're even you know that's kind of what it's been before because we have helped them a
15:02
little bit um which is very different from our previous meeting where we absolutely were on like total war with
15:08
them um but it's been like okay you scratch my back I scratch yours and then
15:13
we're good you know that's it and we haven't really started to establish any long-term like super strong alliance so
15:20
we've been generally focused more in the southeastern part of the board and we haven't really gotten a chance to talk
15:26
about what's happening in the west do you have any meaningful commentary for anything going on there like England or
15:34
Russia uh Russia shenanigans happening there right yeah so I have talked to
15:40
England a little bit and questioned them on why they've kind of they've kind of been helping for the past couple of
15:47
rounds or at least they've looks like they have been or just not really like making any move big moves against them
15:54
um and so I was just kind of questioning like why they were doing that and I I think they kind of have a similar
15:59
mindset to us where like those moments Russia was like beneficial to them so they helped them out but I think that I
16:06
was trying to push them to kind of weaken Russia because like I think it's
16:13
beneficial for any of us uh like even ourselves if uh another team kind of
16:19
weakens uh Russia because then they're going to keep asking us for help and then like they're they're like the
16:25
beggars you know what I mean we don't have to be asking them for help and so we kind of look like the strong like we
16:31
have an air of strength and so I think that's beneficial so I was trying to convince them to try to like go against
16:38
Russia which I think they plan on doing soon i hope and I also think that they're they have this
16:45
like kind of I think it's mostly Jessica but like they kind of act like they don't know what they're doing but I
16:51
think they actually very much know what they're doing and think about it a lot but they do act like oh like I don't
16:57
know what to do we're just trying to get to land like we're just trying to like we're just trying to survive but like I really think that they have like a big
17:04
master plan behind it um and they're doing a good job of like looking kind of weak but like actually being pretty
17:11
strong yeah i think I want I think last time we were talking England had three
17:17
territories now they have five that's definitely not an accident i'll just say that i think I think Jessica is a a
17:25
force to be reckoned with that we shouldn't we shouldn't forget right all right how about we move on to the next
17:32
one yeah let's go on to the next phase here uh where you ordered all units to
17:38
hold or more specifically failed to provide orders
17:46
any reason reflecting back on this moment do you regret not turning anything in
17:52
no everyone keeps asking me "Oh was it a mistake was it like what what's happening oh you blundered." No i I
17:59
stand by what I said we're still This was on purpose we did it for a reason um
18:07
it was because the reason was because they we
18:12
were in a tricky network of of like favors right so Venice uh excuse me um
18:18
France was saying like "Oh you know like we'll help you." France and Russia together were saying "Oh we'll help you
18:24
into Venice if you help us with this." And obviously we didn't want to help Venice move into Venice so we said no to
18:30
that and then the other thing was Russia was saying "Oh we'll help you um in if you cut off con then we'll do this for
18:37
you we'll help you into Munich or something." But we didn't want to do that either so it was just to not betray
18:44
our allies we held everything and to try to build trust with Italy and Turkey and
18:49
at the same time um yeah at the same time there was not a
18:56
lot of other progress that was being made i think this was a fairly what I mean other than Germany
19:05
being forced to disband i don't think this was a particularly eventful round i think there was some good amount of like
19:10
holding support holds that went nowhere so I don't think we were like on the uh
19:18
underhand on this one and the fact that Seline wasn't in class was a really useful thing because
19:24
I the reason I told Strong that I was not moving was he was like he offered me a last minute plan he was like "Okay
19:30
fine we'll help you into Munich if you just give us Venice." Um and then I was
19:35
like "Oh sorry man like I I can't do it without Seline's approval." And
19:41
fortunately she wasn't there so I could be like "Sorry man i can't do it." So it was it was the the effort to hold all
19:47
units was like a plan to not choose a side to basically have your options open
19:55
so that you're able to pick and choose your allies later down the line it was a plan to not help our enemies is what it
20:02
was or the only the only thing we would have
20:08
been able to do was with their support and they were only going to support us if we supported them
20:16
okay it's interesting but wouldn't it wouldn't
20:22
it it was like accepting their support and not giving or not and not not being
20:28
true to your word an option was it ever or do you not want to do that do you want to be an honest player like that
20:34
we do want to be honest we want to be honest players like especially with the people like Italy who we have a strong
20:42
alliance with and we want to be honest with them i think that like like doing a
20:48
deal with France being like okay just go into Venice and then we'll give you Munich like stuff like that i think we
20:54
would I think we're trying actively to avoid that like very actively to avoid
21:00
like taking France aside on that and so we'll we'll that was a move to come up
21:05
with an excuse not to do that because we didn't want to like betray Italy obviously and and they know that like we
21:12
we told them that we're doing that on purpose cuz we don't want to go into uh what is it yeah we don't want to go into
21:17
Venice mhm and I I remember telling everybody that I was not going to move and then Kenan afterwards you're like
21:23
"Oh do you regret do you wish you like you appeared like it was a mistake
21:28
because that would have been like oh man like I wish I could have just gotten my orders in but I didn't." That would have
21:34
made it seem like "Oh man sorry we were going to go through on our word we just couldn't." But I still don't regret
21:40
telling everybody and being like confident about it because I think if we did we would look weak which like can be
21:46
useful because then your enemies underestimate you but then we would also look really bad for our allies and I
21:52
think that would have weakened their trust and I think it's good to have your enemies like I guess fear you right
21:59
because that knows like oh we better work with Austria because they're really smart if we were like "Oh silly me i
22:05
forgot to submit my orders." then France and Russia would never want to reach out and like ask for our help again you know
22:11
i mean do you think it has impacted your alliance with France or Italy or anyone so far i think they still trust us which
22:20
I don't know if it helped it but um it seems like it didn't harm it so yeah and
22:26
I think it would have harmed it if we were like "Oh we're so stupid." You know
22:31
I do think that your other observation of nothing else really really
22:36
interesting is happening this round is correct so why don't we move on to what happens next
22:42
year and really it's just a build in Venice a build in St petersburg and a
22:48
build in St e in in St edinburg sorry all right you know what I meant to say
22:53
um what are your thoughts on Italy building an army in Venice is this also appearances or uh was this something
23:01
that you talked about like what's up with that i did we talk about this i don't
23:07
remember like I don't think we did i think it was just a natural thing for them well actually I don't know we
23:13
didn't talk about this but I'm not concerned about No wait i think what this was is that they were building an
23:18
army to make it seem like they're concerned about us moving into their territory to trick France and Russia into thinking that they're a threat to
23:25
us because it benefits it benefits us for Russia and France to think that we are fighting each other when we're
23:32
actually not so I think that that's what it was at what point at what point though does faking it like kind of harm
23:39
strategically like what Italy could do cuz do you think a fleet would have been more beneficial for Italy to have in its
23:47
fight against France versus an army um maybe i'm Yeah I'm not quite sure why they put an army there instead of like a
23:54
fleet in Rome that or in Naples that could still pressure us but
24:02
um yeah I don't know there is something to be said about that i think unless
24:07
unless they're like the only way that it would be advantageous for them is I guess if they're going for Marseilles
24:13
which I think they are they are yeah um so then they could do that and then start moving the Venice troop into
24:18
Pedmont all right let's move on to the spring
24:24
phase where a lot of stuff is happening it looks like as you mentioned before
24:30
that this was the moment Turkey pledged to be your like your emissary your your
24:38
slave basically ambassador your satellite state
24:44
and do you think this is this that whole interaction is a product of the way that
24:49
you treat people in this game or was it something else that made Turkey do this
24:54
yeah I definitely think it was because of our our honesty and like our courtesy to them because many many times we could
25:00
have just like kind of just gone into helped Russia and like destroyed them from the beginning yeah like it was it
25:07
was hurting us to keep trying to defend Turkey and we were still doing it to gain their trust but I think they knew
25:13
that like at that point like just helping them would be like beating a dead horse so like they I think they
25:19
knew that like they would rather help us um and give up their territory to us
25:25
then give up their territory to Russia at that point so I think that's what it was yeah and that was the whole point of
25:31
why we were doing in the first place cuz we knew that the one territory of Romania wasn't that valuable to us it
25:37
was more of like g earning their trust right so that when it came down to something like this they can you know
25:45
they can use their dying moves defending us and not our enemy the other thing that I think is
25:51
interesting is um Italy almost like be
25:57
uh not necessarily succeeding but not necessarily failing in this campaign with France as you can see France is
26:03
reinforcing bringing its units down to take its territory back do you think
26:08
that France has any chance of succeeding in this and if so how do you feel about
26:14
that um I think France has their I don't
26:20
really know what they're doing but to us they were saying that they were dying
26:26
they were like basically like before this round they were like guys we like to Austria they were like we're dying
26:32
like we're definitely going to die soon we will use our dying moves to help you guys take over here sean was being so
26:38
dramatic yeah sean was like it's over for us like we're using our dying moves to help you guys and please like take
26:45
over Italy if we help you but the thing is like I didn't buy that cuz I don't think they're like on their last legs
26:51
really yeah we'll ask the diplom the two diplomacy experts is France right now on its last legs i don't think we should
26:58
say earnest okay well it's a rhetorical question because they're obviously not
27:04
right at least not not even close to what Germany and Turkey are they had they have five whole territories italy
27:10
has five it's not like a It's Yeah it's I think Sean was trying to convince us
27:16
of something and I don't think we bought it
27:22
um I I believe this is the last order phase that we got going so moving on to
27:29
the present in this area right here what do you think is the most important thing
27:35
for you to do moving forward i think I think we just need to keep
27:41
doing what we're doing kind of have our secret like very strong alliance with Italy but also keep the doors open for
27:49
Russia keep the door open for France and even England like try to not appear so
27:55
like closed off to um like external relations because like they can help us
28:02
in different ways and I think that they know that because I mean we are looking
28:07
pretty good I if I do say so myself so I think it's it's a good thing for us to
28:13
like keep our alliance because it has worked in our favor but also keep our
28:18
doors open because that's also worked in our favor yeah i think what I'm thinking about is like the rhythm of expanding
28:26
and defending and expanding and defending because I think what we've seen with the other ones that have
28:31
failed uh namely Germany is overexpansion and
28:37
they kind of like spread themselves out too thin and then they get weak so I think like right now we are in a
28:42
dangerous position i'm hoping it's fall so we're going to have a a build order soon i really want to fill up Vienna and
28:48
Budapest i don't I want to be a little bit more defensive now but I think we
28:54
need to really careful we've done a good job of this in the past but I want to keep doing it a really careful balance
28:59
of like knowing when to be aggressive and knowing when to not be aggressive like knowing when to go all out and
29:06
attack Russia and Munich at the same time and then knowing when to hold all our troops just to defend you know
29:12
so I asked this question last time and I really want to ask it again because you will still have this very strong
29:18
alliance with Italy when do you think that you will need to eventually turn on them for real this time
29:26
well honestly like our plan right now is like even when we get to the point of
29:33
like turning on them quote unquote turning on them I think it'll be a kind
29:38
of mutual thing like I think that point will come when like Germany is
29:44
completely gone maybe if France is completely gone and if Russia is very
29:49
weak then I think at that point we'll be like "Okay you know we've we've both done our parts we've both helped each
29:55
other become like maybe the two the top two top three strongest on the board."
30:01
At this point it's every man for themselves but I think that it'll be mutual and that we'll both be like "Okay
30:06
like thanks for doing your part thus far now we must go our separate ways and see who comes out on top exactly i think we
30:13
we would love it if it would just be like the two of us are dominating and then we just shake hands and we're like
30:18
you know let the games begin pretty much well I don't think Funny how you say that because
30:26
um I mean it looks like at least to the an outsider's perspective doesn't know
30:32
about your alliance with that games have already begun so when do you think that
30:37
facade will drop for other countries as in when do you think others will um know that you are allied with Italy and that
30:44
you're lying about your supposed animosity i hope that by the time they realize it it's too late and we're
30:50
already in charge that's the plan because we keep evading it like as long
30:56
as we keep finding good reasons like for example we moved into Munich there's a
31:01
good reason why we can't go into Venice anymore right because we're expanding we're capitalizing on Germany dying
31:08
stuff like that so I think we just need to keep finding good reasons to do that if we can move out of Trieste and if
31:14
Venice can move out there too that would be really useful because then we'd have no way even to attack each other as long
31:21
as we keep something up like that that's like a really good plausible excuse the facade will remain
31:30
i see because we both we both the advantage is Italy has France we have
31:36
Russia we both have really competent superpowers that we have to fight and
31:42
it's true it's not just an excuse it's true that it would hurt us both to start
31:47
attacking each other as well so you guys have this ideal scenario
31:54
where it's you and Italy on top and you are able to battle it out but that
32:01
situation is very far from this current board state anything can happen and at a
32:06
certain point I mean what if what if Italy has like five more centers than
32:11
you how is it fair for you to just duke it out when you clearly aren't equal
32:16
well I I mean I know this is wishful thinking but I don't think that will
32:21
happen because I think that uh because they know that that's our mutual plan and because we are helping each other so
32:28
well right now and because like I think that we both have our own plans that
32:33
don't really involve us crushing each other like in the coming rounds i think that we'll grow pretty like mutually i
32:40
think we'll grow at a pretty like similar rate which is the goal um yeah if it if it does get to the point where
32:47
they're like five centers ahead of us I think it's time to maybe reach out to
32:53
our other you know friends that's why we want to stay a little bit nice with
32:58
France and Russia and every time we don't do what they say it's not like a open resistance but it's
33:04
like a "Oh sorry we just we just had to go for this other thing." But yeah like said also I want to say I think we are
33:10
pretty good at like mo moderating each other like I remember earlier we were
33:16
considering moving into Tyia and Italy was like no that's too much you guys are like encroaching on our space like
33:21
please don't do that we would consider it an offense if you did it and we didn't so if they started saying
33:27
something similar we would also be equally stern and be like "No like if you move into there we'll consider it an offense and that's a breaking of our
33:33
treaty." And hopefully that means that we'll stay equal
33:40
out of everybody here on on the board who do you think has the best prospect
33:46
of winning um very hard question probably Russia
33:54
i'll be honest they just have the most territories and has the most experience
34:00
we know he's quite cunning i think Russia yeah i think if
34:06
it wouldn't be them it might be Italy i think I would
34:12
say the exact same thing i'd say Russia probably just Ove is a powerhouse he is
34:18
a true slimy Russian he He will find a way you know what I mean i like how you specify it's only Adve and not Mi or I
34:26
think No no okay my bad i think I think uh Mi and Samir are like they're like I
34:34
feel like they they both have not been as present in the game as Audrey yeah
34:40
but I do think that they definitely like it's not just a obviously but like it's mostly a but I think that if it's not
34:48
Russia it would be Italy because they like Mac also has experience right
34:55
does she yes she does yeah and she's very I think people perceive her to be
35:01
trustworthy and I think she is trustworthy so I think like people would be willing to help her and and Nathan um
35:09
yeah so I think either one of those two the other thing well it's funny you
35:15
mentioned that like Ove is the slimy slimy meat bag you know this Russian that is all over the place um why do you
35:22
think he in spite of this has been able to stay in so long like what's the what's the thing that he has done that
35:28
has a secret recipe yeah because like he seemed like on the back foot last time we were talking i think Russia well
35:35
first off tactically is in a strong position for the early game because they
35:40
have like they pretty much only have one side to attack like we have to worry about enemies on all sides of us they
35:47
pretty much just like can push in one direction and not have to worry that much like all their home territories are
35:53
like super far away and hard to reach so they can just keep expanding and like
35:58
growing and they start with the most troops anyway so that combined with Ove's experience
36:06
i think it's something about the way Ove like communicates something about like every time I've talked to him I've been
36:14
you know wary and cautious but also kind of like I don't know i very much appreciate the way he like communicates
36:21
and like um conveys himself because he to me at least it feels very like
36:28
genuine it feels like he's like genuinely trying to enjoy this game and play it not genuine as in like he's
36:35
telling the truth all the time but genuine as like he's playing this game to have fun he's playing this game to
36:41
play the game you know what I mean totally engaged and I really like that's something I admire and that's something
36:46
that I think that the other players can probably feel and I think that's something that people want to support
36:53
especially if you yourself are in it like you want to see other people in it too and I think that's something that is
36:58
helping him a lot um when he's kind of communicating not not that he's always truthful but that he's always honestly
37:05
trying to play do you think that was the folly of Germany
37:10
possibly yes I actually do yeah cuz when someone's not in it you
37:16
know and you don't really want to like entertain it you know yeah i hope everyone stays as engaged um
37:23
because the game is far more fun that way agreed 100% i you see that that's the
37:29
other reason why I was really happy when everybody was saying "Yeah I'm really engaged in this thank you so much." Because I've had a couple of times where
37:37
like people are just not even really engaging and it's the game is completely different it sucks yeah like I think
37:44
that as so long as there's at least one other country that I'm fighting against that's genuinely in it I will not back
37:51
down i will not like you know quit or like feel like I'm done with the game
37:56
like I'm going to play till end for sure it just it's more satisfying for me and
38:01
for everybody I think mhm also it's like school lightening up you know it's like we have time now now is the time to go
38:09
all in on a you know silly board game right yeah that's right well I mean
38:14
unless you're taking like psychology or a physics sure
38:19
do you guys have any Well Ernest actually do you have any questions of your own well yeah to move away from the
38:25
board a bit um one common pitfall I guess like a common thing for diplomacy
38:33
players to do is to spend hours staring at the board just thinking about possible moves have you guys done that
38:39
yet i don't think I do that as much maybe I think Gabe looks at the board more than
38:46
I do i'm kind of like more of a a vibe type person like I just kind of like
38:51
think about it i think about what the other countries may be thinking and I think about what would be the best for
38:56
us and then I kind of moderate off of that like a lot of the times Gabe will look at the board he'll come up with
39:03
possible moves and then he'll tell me and then I'll be like "Okay I think that we should do this cuz like this is best
39:08
for us but also we should not do this because it might send the wrong impression to this side of the board." like I think he's a lot more like
39:14
looking at the board and like coming up coming up with moves uh and I'm more like thinking about it about like the
39:21
external like situation in everyone's minds and then like moderating what he's
39:27
kind of presenting yeah I have a a in a sandbox on Backstabber running that's an
39:34
exact replica of our current board set and I use it all the time to test out different moves and I'll be like "Okay
39:40
we can move this move this move this." If it goes according to plan this could happen if it doesn't accord go according
39:46
to plan and it fails this way this could happen so yeah I definitely like looking at the board planning ahead analyzing um
39:54
yes I do it a lot i really Okay so I really want to teach you all the fun little shenanigans you can do cuz there
40:01
are there are a few things but I think it'd be unfair i mean maybe I can go one day and access maybe if you go around if
40:07
you teach it to everybody it would be fair right yeah like I do a slideshow on advanced diplomacy
40:12
tactics and earnest well do you have any questions for us guys
40:19
oh um where do you guys see the game going next week
40:24
well maybe not obviously you can't say in terms of like I mean this will take this this we'll take that but like in
40:30
general people you know vibes in general I am anticipating like I am
40:37
anticipating like a transition away from the diplomatic side of it and more into
40:42
the allout oh we got I got enough units to support myself I'm just going to attack everybody kind of side yeah yeah
40:48
and I think especially especially as Germany and Turkey go under i I think I I disagree with Ken i think it's going
40:55
to be even more diplomatic with more troops on the ground that is it is also it is also true and in many ways when
41:01
you get into the later stages of this game it it's like it's like restarting the game because you have all these
41:07
other powers that you are now next to and you need to diplomatically figure it out
41:13
let's say you're Turkey and then you expand into Austria suddenly you have to negotiate with Italy Germany and uh
41:20
France right you didn't have to negotiate with France a lot now you have to and that changes the dynamic of the
41:29
game so Ken's right in a lot yes it's a new
41:34
game or it feels like at least mhm
41:43
well I think we have covered most of everything that we needed to thank you
41:48

41:56
