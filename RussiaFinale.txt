0:00
fine i I do want I'm sorry i'm I would I would like it if we could go as long as we could because you are the winner and
0:07
I think your thoughts are important because of that that is true those are good points
0:13
so I don't think you see I I think we can we can pretty much get close to the
0:18
end quite fast because would you car how would you
0:24
characterize this um this part of the game as would you characterize it more
0:31
like more focused on strategy was there not as much talking before there was far less towards the latter year or so there
0:39
was almost zero communication between individual countries i'm sure there was communication between the Austrians and
0:45
the English for instance or between allied countries but the only diplomacy I had was with the French player and
0:52
that was just hey France you should attack England and do this and that really there was nothing else as far as
0:58
diplomacy actually go and the break come on Samir I can't believe this the man
1:04
has the brains of the entire operation here i mean we're lucky to have him joining at the last second he's finally
1:11
he's finally here for an interview the guy was designed by me he's taking All
1:18
right guys i mean this is just not true i don't even He's speaking truth he's speaking he's bringing
1:24
How would you know cheated that's good that's a good point that's a good point what if it was What if it really was odd
1:31
like faking You notice how sometimes a like when you're talking he kind of like looks away to the distance for a bit that
1:38
That's us yeah the prince of Moscow over here so this is where we left off last
1:45
time spring 1907 why did you wait so long to attack
1:50
the Austrians when you could have tried attacking him now yeah I'm not sure i That was a blunder on my part i
1:57
definitely should have for some reason I thought that I could get the Austrians and Italians to attack each other which
2:04
why I kept saying "Hey Austria if you don't move towards Italy I'll invade you and the Austrians refused every single
2:11
time." So eventually I didn't invade them i could have cut that all out and just invaded Austria directly and that
2:16
would have saved a lot of time you could have maybe won if you did that too right
2:22
exactly but I I foolishly believed that Austria is going to move against Italy
2:28
and they just never did shame
2:33
so there's there's going to be a couple interesting things that happen
2:39
how would you characterize the English game plan against you do you respect that fight or
2:45
or what i respect it i The issue Okay I love the English but there was a moment
2:52
where or there were a couple moments where they made a couple key blunders and we'll get to that strategy wise i'll
2:59
get to that but I mean I respect it i respect There were some great moves in there towards the end they
3:06
convia that was brilliant oh my god i would have never thought of that that was great that was Samir would have
3:13
thought of that but I didn't that was truly wonderful yep i remember so the
3:19
the other thing that's kind of interesting here I see this is the moment where you decided enough was enough i'm going to take Bulgaria again
3:26
but right here over here um the English and the French are having a little bit of a domestic dispute what do you think
3:33
about that wonderful wonderful this is This is all I wanted all I wanted is to have the other because if France was to
3:40
not sneak into England's home territories and take them I wouldn't have won because that's two extra
3:46
territories for the English two extra armies for the English all of a sudden um they're that much more of a threat
3:53
and so if England and France never fought it would not be great for us the Russians because we knew that we were
3:59
going to have to involve ourselves attacking the Austrians in the Balkans and therefore we need the other major
4:05
power to have a similar issue right i see and in the end France I have I got
4:13
to say it i'm I love the French players because they made a comeback i would say they really did i the French players
4:19
Sean and Elena my goodness absolute cinema the way they convoyed and so many
4:25
great convoys in this game towards the latter half of this game that I would have never expected me personally I'm a
4:31
very greedy player when I see Dot I take Dot and so when they had opportunity to
4:36
take Liverpool with a fleet I thought oh yeah great awesome but when they convoy an army into Liverpool oh my god an army
4:43
in the English centers is devastating it's devastating and that was so smart you didn't have I you know I suspected
4:50
that I mean like I feel like this is a diss on them but I suspected that maybe you suggested that move to them cuz I
4:57
wasn't expecting it either i was like what there's no No that was really so smart i I kind of just to break the I
5:05
guess the confidentiality i was driving them
5:11
uh after the weeble meet oh yeah they were plotting something and I could tell
5:17
because you know Sean was twiddling his thumbs is it again what was it i mean the game talking about I keep talking
5:24
like I wonder what it will like I for a moment I wonder what would happen and then I like it
5:29
instantly clicked when I reexamined the map later that day because I was oh yeah they're definitely going to convoy an
5:35
army into Britain and I was pleased to see that it succeeded that was smart and
5:40
that really was a smart move so moving on to this phase after you destroy a build in
5:48
Warsaw well nothing really much happened here you decide to support France into
5:55
Austrian centers what was it what was it like there what happened exactly yeah at this point in time we were still
6:01
maintaining a facade of diplomacy with the Austrians i told the Austrians "Hey
6:07
if you move into Tyolia I'll move into Prussia." I never moved into Prussia um but this was like another the final stab
6:14
in the coffin between Austrian and Russian diplomatic talks um after I
6:21
moved into Bohemia the Austrians knew I could not be trusted i'm surprised it took them this long after I took
6:27
Bulgaria and Romania as well but for some reason they foolishly believe that hey I'd go into Prussia and they'd go
6:33
into Tyrone and that would be that but yeah I supported them to Munich i don't think it worked the attack or I don't
6:40
think I supported them properly i should have used Berlin or whatever but yeah at this point it was
6:48
clear between us and the Austrians that diplomatic talks were over officially
6:54
if you had to describe your relationship with the Austrians how would you describe it it was great towards the
7:00
start there was this one move back in 1905 or six when when the entire board teamed up against the English and that
7:06
still remains one of my favorite parts of this game when the French the English and the Austrians rally rally behind a
7:12
common banner and kicked out the British from Kila Berlin that was great i love that but
7:18
unfortunately I want to be the SK and the Austrians are in the way of me being the south therefore they had to go shame
7:28
big Game of Thrones over here i mean you win or you die right you can
7:33
only be one throne yep that's how Moving on couple
7:38
interesting things here there's a mess of orders over here we can get to really soon but we got the Italians moving down
7:46
at first this is scary right and for for reasons that we'll go into later it
7:51
becomes less scary as time goes on lions yeah go ahead go ahead go ahead i
7:57
mean this entire game I got very lucky because this entire game my opponents were plagued with a lot of strategic
8:04
errors and the Italians as we'll see made a lot of blunders i mean aside from
8:09
just the forgetting to turn in orders there just other common super common issues they had that if they played well
8:17
could have been really scary for me and probably would have made me lose my Turkish centers luckily they never
8:22
managed to get past their strategic blunders and that allowed me to keep uh Smyrna and Khan but I was scared of them
8:30
moving against me and time and time again they did mean to Oh wow he left and time and time again they did mean to
8:36
take my centers it wasn't until the last final move that Italy had enough and stabbed Austria and eventually just
8:42
killed the Austrians but so the other So here's the interesting thing actually
8:48
there's a couple interesting things interesting thing number two aside from Italy going into the uh the eastern part
8:55
of the Mediterranean it seems like Austria here like protected instead of
9:00
trying to attack you mhm what do you think about that i mean at this point no one could trust
9:08
the Italians because the Italians maintained this diplomatic relationship
9:14
of just not committing to anything and I don't think it's a great way to play this game because it means that
9:20
everyone's weary of you to a certain extent um eventually by the Italian moves the Austrians could trust the
9:27
Italians because they were so anti-Russian and so anti-Turkish in their moves but I feel like the Italians
9:33
could have cleared all this up by just telling the Austrians "Hey we're not going to attack you guys and we'll prove
9:38
it to you as well." Because I do believe that the Austrians at a certain point in the game were scared of the Italians
9:45
moving against them when there was no reason to do so there was no reason for Italy to move against Austria unless
9:51
they just wanted to hand me the win on a silver platter right and so if the Italians just cleared up their diplomacy
9:58
this could have been a lot smoother but yeah I mean it makes sense for the Austrians to be afraid of the Italians i
10:04
was more I was more interested in the fact that it they were clearly just defending against you and that they
10:11
didn't try attacking you at all or also that I had moved to Bohemia
10:17
so at this point in time getting Budapest was guaranteed also probably why they didn't want to I mean time and
10:24
again they had supported their Bohemia army and once they left Bohemia
10:29
um mid became free to get Budapest i believe the French did lose Munich that
10:35
was a shame but I did need to get Budapest so I couldn't support hold them in yeah a lot of stuff happened here actually uh so here you tried to move
10:43
Berlin into Keel with support from Munich and Rur but unfortunately it fails this was the first of many not
10:51
many the first of the English downfall because they did cut me in rur but they
10:57
left Belgium completely open and they walk out of Belgium they leave a center on the table and by cutting me in roar
11:05
they have which was unnecessary too they had Baltic Sea supporting Kio so it made
11:10
no sense to cut roar by cutting me in roar they allow the French to continue
11:17
existing because if they controlled Belgium France would have to disband another army i believe they would they
11:24
would be net zero because net zero sorry yeah um and now they'd have a far larger
11:30
threat on Paris the English would be able to mount a far larger threat on Breast or on Paris but by leaving this
11:36
here by leaving Belgium they allow France to build an army and all of a sudden there's now a threat against the
11:42
English as we'll see in later moves what do you think about this bounce here in Denmark
11:47
i have no idea what I really don't know i don't know why who what i mean I'd
11:53
like to believe it was a mistaken move and they accidentally put in um Denmark
12:00
twice like they had Sweden to Denmark and they had Eden versus Denmark i really don't know why Sweden would go
12:05
down to Denmark i I genuinely don't know i mean if you guys know and you can tell me that would be great because I'll just
12:10
I'll just I'll just tell you right now yeah it was a mistake and Jessica is so mad over it she was like yeah there's no
12:18
way because if they did go to Denmark right now and then Khan went to Leavonia
12:23
next that could be scary so it wouldn't have worked because Warsaw would bounce in Leavonia one more question before we
12:30
move on to the next area um when Italy did this did you try talking to them try
12:36
talking them down or did you see I I really did um unfortunately the Italians saw right past me as they should i
12:43
offered them Greece many times over and over again but I knew past like the second or third time they refused taking
12:49
Greece i knew that it made no sense to continue diplomatic relations and just you know it makes no sense to give them
12:56
anything or talk to them at all because it's a waste of air essentially all right that's interesting i don't think
13:02
it's ever worth it to completely sever off diplomatic relations that's true that is true i just I don't know i felt
13:09
it was more useful for me to use my diplomacy time to talk with the French because the French were my allies you
13:14
know if if the Austrians All right well I think this is a bad example but if the Austrians never continued their
13:20
relations with England I mean if they continued their relations with the England they might
13:26
have been able to launch a more coordinated front against you and they could win for sure um and towards the
13:32
latter moves of the game everyone or at least the Italians English and Austrians
13:38
had gotten their act together and they were starting to move against me and it was working um I believe that my last
13:43
move even if the Austrians didn't support hold would have still worked out um just because I had calculated that
13:50
way so that Austrian support wouldn't matter if they helped against or if they
13:55
helped the English against me but um yeah it it really was scary towards those latter few moves
14:03
the the next move so I actually think that this
14:09
is almost like this is like an okay year for you i would say cuz there's some
14:14
there's some bad stuff happening here what do you think about the Austrian moves here
14:21
i mean it worked yeah good on them i don't know how I I don't know why
14:26
actually no I do know why um Romania didn't support Budapest just because I knew they would have tapped me so I
14:32
tapped them back instead just to prevent Bulgaria from being attacked which it did get attacked i believe the Italians
14:37
told the Austrians again this is all conjecture but I believe the Italians promised the Austrian support in
14:44
Bulgaria it never came just because they wanted to get Smyrna or Khan for themselves and that's why the Austrians
14:50
attacked Bulgaria because it makes no sense for them to attack a single unit by themselves to dislodge it um luckily
14:58
the Italians did make some blunders for some reason they went with this pivot over here a G in to Eastern Med and Ionian to a G in when they could have
15:05
simplified the entire maneuver and just do Ionian C to eastern Med and keep a G in a G in and that would be crushing
15:12
against my fleets against my armies in Smeirna and Khan because now they have two against one and I would need Khan
15:18
and SMA to support hold each other but luckily for some reason they went with this weird maneuver of Aian to eastern
15:25
med and A to A and that allowed me to block it out you know what okay go ahead
15:30
Ernest well I I think if not for Austria's blunder here in Greece I think
15:38
you would have lost Bulgaria right because how to lose or how to lose Bulgaria so um Serbia could
15:46
have been supported into Yeah but then Rum would move into Serbia yeah but Rum
15:51
top Serbia yeah but then you could just move Triest in there and then you could leave Budapest because Bulgaria is more
15:58
hurtful to your position than Budapest it is that is true um I just like the
16:04
point no it wouldn't have worked anyways because if or wait no listen you're
16:10
you're cutting support you're cutting the support of you attack because it cuts support for a for a attack on
16:17
Bulgaria right so yeah I never thought about that actually Serbia definitely could move into Bulgaria and that would make me
16:23
disband forcibly but I would get Serbia obviously budapest moves back that would
16:29
be crushing that's a good point i don't see that line yeah that would not be fun it would cut you in half essentially because it would Yeah that would be
16:36
crushing upcoming is actually the affformentioned convoy orders which happen on the same turn
16:43
it's crazy it's like art which we can get to later you do you do you do you do
16:49
some map art later with the army in Smyrna i do i try this is great though
16:56
credit where credit is due that move from Denmark to Levonia was great by Jessica that was great because how else
17:03
do you bring an army to attack me if not through the entire Scan that is great
17:08
that is so smart i never even saw it coming i never like I guess to an extent when they put army Denmark I was like
17:14
"Oh yeah they're going to convoy somewhere." But I thought that convo to go to like Prussia or something levonia
17:19
was really smart um that was great i got lucky this move for some reason they
17:25
didn't move back or like they held army Sweden instead of moving army Sweden back to Norway if they were one turn
17:30
earlier I wouldn't have gotten St pete so I just got lucky on that um what else oh yeah i mean the
17:39
Bulgarian the Bulgarian unit is destroyed while you O yes yeah a shame
17:46
truly a shame and also I would also call What would you What do you think about the Italian moves now because things are
17:52
getting a little bit spread out here again really odd because they could just
17:58
support themselves into Aian eastern Med supports Ioni into a Gian and they win
18:04
control of like I can't do anything about that for some reason they keep tapping me in Smyrna which does nothing
18:11
like I'm not going to move Smirna and eventually I started making map art out of Smyrna because Smeirna is just a unit
18:16
to hold like if Eastern Med supported Iodian to Aian that would be spooky everybody
18:23
starts playing gunboat diplomacy yeah no at this point in time it is gunboat for those watching i guess so
18:30
because like all you're doing is just entering orders not really talk i mean like I am talking to France yeah I am talking what What exactly are you
18:39
talking to France about is it just go anti- England go anti- England that's it that's really it that's what I feel like
18:45
is the I feel like the I was just giving them like like I was just giving like like tactical advice i was being like a
18:51
person to consult um because but I mean they didn't need it because Sean and Elena are great at this game they are
18:59
born naturals and that convoy move proves it cinema cinema it it just shows to me
19:05
that the latter three years were rushed in a way they really were it wasn't it
19:11
wasn't you were playing a different version of diplomacy than the past seven years i would say that the other
19:18
countries namely Austria Italy and England were still in talks and I know
19:23
that for a fact because they all started meeting together in unison so they were still playing diplomacy as diplomacy was
19:29
that being maintaining diplomatic relations naturally being board top no
19:34
one's going to want to maintain diplomatic relations with me right and that's just how diplomacy works no one
19:39
wants to talk nicely to board top except for like France because France is going
19:44
to be a natural ally of Russia seeing as we're on opposite sides of the board but I mean one second
19:58
actually sorry but I mean no one's going to want to talk to Board right because it makes no sense to maintain relations
20:04
with that individual and I guess it's just a natural part of this game right
20:11
of the simulation that you're going to have a degradation of talks and that's
20:16
going to result in a gunboatesque style of gameplay for those who don't know what gunboat is
20:22
gunboat is diplomacy but you do not talk to anyone
20:27
which is fun too i've played a couple gunboat games but you you can talk to people through your actions on the board
20:33
i.e you can you can input incorrect orders and stuff but like the I think
20:38
gumbo's a little bit ridiculous it takes the one of the best parts of diplomacy out of diplomacy diplomacy yeah there's
20:45
no diplomacy in diplomacy at that point mhm moving on to the next phase you
20:51
build a fleet in Sevastapole very interesting which I did need that i did need that fleet of because at this point
20:58
in time I thought oh for sure the Italians are going to finally succeed in moving to Aian of course I was wrong
21:05
luckily but if they did move to Aian I would need I would need fleet sev to go
21:10
into black sea so I could do con support hold support hold con and black sea support hold Romania for instance just
21:17
so everything could stay cohesive of course that proved unnecessary and black seeded some other stuff down the line
21:23
but this was an important unit to have so I guess sacrificing Bulgaria for fleet was I wouldn't say worth it but it
21:30
was a sacrifice I would take so now this
21:35
is the year where you knew that it was
21:40
going to be the last one as the current boardtop you It's It's a desperate chase to make sure that you maintain your
21:47
center count it is yeah and the very beginning of the year does not look good
21:52
you're forced out of Romania austria's back in Vienna you're out of St petersburg and also disgusting berlin is
22:00
taken i know i mean I was terrified at this at
22:05
this point of the game i thought it was all over really I did luckily I did see a line where things might end up working
22:12
and it would be a 50/50 of me winning or we losing once this this had all happened oh yeah i began doing map art
22:19
now i began doing square now too eden breath i actually I'm actually very curious about like Sure i guess I guess
22:25
it's pretty obvious why you would do it like there's no other better thing for that unit to do but why did you choose specifically to move it to Edenboro it's
22:32
like northernmost point that's also a center so it would make the biggest line
22:38
and be the most annoying to look at and like make the board as disgusting as possible that was it yeah
22:45
um so go on with your thoughts on how you lost like a bunch of centers this
22:51
phase yeah I thought I could convince the English to go to Norwegian Z to like
22:56
you know prevent Edenber from falling so I did try to maintain some semblance of diplomacy in that vein it failed
23:03
obviously um what I think is really interesting is the fact that England used Finland to go into St pete not
23:10
Leavonia i'm a very safe diplomacy player and when I see something that's forced I will take that forcing move
23:17
this move that England used in the north is not forcing because if Warsaw tapped Leavonia then they don't win St pete
23:24
this turn right do you think do you think that was a purposeful strategic risk thinking that you would think that
23:29
they're moving Leavonia into and that that was smart too i would say they got more lucky off of that than just
23:34
thinking of that maybe they did i mean Jessica is smart jessica's convoy from Denmark to Leavonia is a master stroke i
23:42
think they just got lucky off of this that I didn't stop them but I mean what do I know then again there was a line
23:48
where if I do tap Leavonia and this order fails they just put Leavonia in St pete next turn and use Finland and
23:53
Norway to support it there and they still win St pete by the end of the year so I guess that is possible although I
24:00
do think this was unnecessarily risky on the English part it did work out for them so I can't knock it too much what
24:05
was your Sorry I think it was unnecessarily risky on their part
24:12
what was your goal in holding Constantinople dude okay the I meant for it to tap bull
24:21
apparently it turns out to specify coast which I which I Yes you didn't specify the coast this is a move where it didn't
24:28
specify coast right han was supposed to tap bull any coast works east coast south coast whatever [ __ ] coast you
24:34
want and if that were to happen but no no I get why it's a real rule i
24:41
looked it up too it's a I respect it it it is correct the real the real reason why I said you needed to specify coast
24:48
was because Constantinople can access either either coast yeah which is fair and if if it if it if it was in like Rum
24:55
and it was moving to Bulgaria I don't think you need to specify coast there because it can only move into the east coast but you that's fair yeah
25:02
it's it's a fair call I I didn't like the call but it's a fair call so it stands I suppose but yeah Khan was
25:08
supposed to tap bull and if that happened Romania would stand and Romania would be lost um as for my goal in
25:15
Vienna my goal in Vienna was firstly I I didn't think that the Austrians would work this much with the English they
25:21
were very synchronized with the English i got lucky a couple times too i did
25:27
Munich go to Rar if uh if England didn't bounce me in RER I would have lost
25:32
Munich as well and that would have been terrifying what was the goal what the what was the goal of moving Munich to
25:37
RER so I thought that Tyia would naturally go to Vienna because Vienna is
25:44
a center that belongs to the Austrians that I've taken so I thought Tyoli to Vienna Tria support Tai to Vienna and I
25:51
just do Vienna to Budapest galia support Vienna to Budapest and that would force Budapest to disband entirely that never
25:58
happened they went triass to Vienna entirely to Munich um but I mean I just calculated wrong
26:06
and my idea to go Munich to Rar was just Munich is going to remain open and
26:12
Warsaw is going to CIA so I could just do Sicia to Munich next turn and bounce out um any potential Austrian threat
26:19
there and just being in Ruer gives me a far more threatening position on the English since the English left Holland
26:25
open all right i'm guessing you're loving the fact that Italy failed to turn in orders
26:32
here i love that they would have done because I mean consider judging based on
26:37
last turn where they failed to realize what a support move was they might not have realized this turn either i might
26:43
have gotten lucky twice in a row um but yeah I love it great it's wonderful for
26:49
me because now a front to me broadway to what extent do you think outofboard
26:56
attrition affected um the move set out of board what
27:02
attrition like you you get burnt out that kind of a lot a lot the this is
27:08
what the the Italians had I think three no moves three no shows or whatever
27:14
and I mean that's just crushing three holds is going to leave you out of this game and the Italians since they were
27:20
against me means that's great for me but yeah I would say a significant part of my victory not a substant a substantial
27:28
part at least to the Italians and the Austrians I suppose just not turning in moves the
27:36
Yeah it's funny the game about war is so realistic you have war fatigue in it i
27:42
know right just getting burned out at the towards the end yeah towards the end
27:48
actually I stopped even like I used to talk about diplomacy a ton during lunch i just stopped talking about it period
27:54
with other people because I secretly hoped that if I stopped bringing it up to like the Italians and the Austrians
28:00
they would forget about it and just not turn in moves i guess it kind of worked because on finals day today I didn't
28:06
talk about diplomacy once with anyone with the Austrians especially and my thought was if I just don't bring it up
28:12
they'll forget and if they forget just go home and not turn into maybe I think it's it's a fine line that actually kind
28:20
of worked that actually kind of worked yeah i I think it's a fine line between
28:26
like making sure that you have a balance of you know you're not playing diplomacy
28:31
all the freaking time right hence why we banned diplomacy on weekends mhm
28:37
and having a stable interest in the game and you can see the stable interest kind of waning here mhm
28:45
the next move is my best probably i like when you submitted the Kasa it's almost
28:52
it's almost like Kasablanca's like masterpiece no truly it is m tall male
28:57
tall this truly is my masterpiece if I if I had to give one Oh my god what a
29:03
what I I I'm still gushing over this Moscow move i think that's one of the
29:08
most brilliant things ever i know right because here's my idea i knew that if
29:13
the Austrians did turn in moves they would tap Sev with Rome right just naturally they would tap Sev with Rome
29:20
inevitably and if they tapped Sev with Rome that would cut any and all support to Moscow meaning that Moscow would fall
29:28
if they double rushed it so it makes no sense to defend Moscow at all therefore
29:34
I did Moscow to Warsaw because that's it's a 50/50 either the English go for
29:40
Warsaw or they go for Moscow and I thought I might as well guarantee myself a 50% chance of gear of keeping my home
29:48
center safe by having Moscow go to Warsaw and just completely abandoned the defense of Moscow because I knew that if
29:54
the Austrians were to turn in moves which they probably should have and if they did they would guarant I guarantee you if Gabe turned in moves and if Gabe
30:01
and Selen did moves they would do rum to Sev and Rum to Sev would cut any support
30:06
so it makes no sense to try and hold on to Moscow i might as well try and defend Warsaw and it ended up working in my
30:12
favor so this I I added Sev to Rum G supports
30:17
and Black Sea supports Khan to Bull which gives me a double win back in over
30:23
here and they can't have supported either because when they went to triest all support here is cut so this was
30:28
forcing moves even if like whatever Austria did couldn't have prevented my moves here because they were all forcing
30:35
um as for Budapest to Serbia and that was all luck um I thought that hopefully
30:42
the Austrians might be preoccupied with tapping me in Munich for instance and forget to tap me in Bud or like if they
30:49
tap me in Budapest it would just be like a one army tap or a two army tap or if they do force me out of Budapest they
30:54
would fail to cover Serbia like my idea was this was a Hail Mary right here Budapest Serbia and my thinking was even
31:01
if they force me out of Budapest they leave Serbia open so I could like in the retreat phase go to Serbia get a center
31:08
back um as for Germany Munich taps kegia
31:13
support Prussia and Berlin pretty simple classic stuff over there
31:19
i love the French the French are great people they just in Liverpool all of a
31:24
sudden England has just lost two of their home centers and I didn't need it because England would have still lost
31:30
even if they had Liverpool and Eden bro but it it's just great to have that extra security in case they did take
31:36
Moscow right damn that's crazy the final nail in the Italians moving into Greece
31:44
finally it took them long enough but finally they did what what I asked them to do since like 1908 but yeah great
31:51
moves and the the the Austria finally becomes the sick man of Europe austria
31:58
finally dies yeah being in last place my god and I mean I I doubt we're going
32:04
to we're not going to play this anymore this game's over now if we were kept playing what would you have done
32:11
differently like Okay let's rewind back a whole year before you learned that the game would end 1910 what would you have
32:18
done differently and then what would you have done from that state of the board i
32:23
probably wouldn't have changed anything honestly i would keep trying to talk to the Italians and keep trying to talk to
32:30
the Austrians more than I did and not play in as much of a gunboat style way of
32:36
playing but I probably wouldn't change my moves all that much because my spring moves were really bad and that like I
32:43
misgueded everything but I don't think I would have had the foresight to change
32:48
anything if I knew the game wouldn't end anyways maybe if the game wasn't going
32:53
to end in 1910 the Austrians wouldn't have helped out the English as much and therefore I would have like gained
32:59
Budapest or Vienna and like not lost as many builds in that spring phase but I mean I don't know it's all a gamble but
33:07
luckily it ended up working out so yeah that I just want to make sure that Greece that moving into Greece thing
33:12
wasn't any coordinated thing it was just them moving into Greece or did you convince them that turn you didn't you
33:18
said you didn't do any diplomacy right i did not i didn't even That was just Macers because I guess Mac re because I
33:26
had been telling Mac since 1908 that hey um this is like way before back in like
33:31
yeah back in like four turns ago that hey Mac you guys are the smallest country and when the game ends you're
33:38
going to be in last place therefore you might as well stab Austria and get Greece and maybe that rubbed off and
33:44
played some role in her deciding to take Greece maybe it didn't maybe it was just Mac wanting to take Greece but
33:49
eventually um they did take Greece they did stab the Austrians and now the Austrians I mean if we continue playing
33:55
they would be a dead power so you do when throughout these interviews you've mentioned your favorite parts your
34:01
downfalls your your rising moments out of everything was my waterlue and fall
34:08
was my oustralitz truly out of everything that has happened what
34:14
was your favorite part it still remains I forget what year it was of all of us
34:21
1906 I believe uh 1906 fall I think here it is oh my god it's beautiful it really
34:27
is we got Kasablanca's attack is it it's so good because it's so simple and yet
34:34
everyone works together every piece works in cohesion to take down the
34:40
English and it's beautiful it is so beautiful the only thing that could have made it better is Moscow tapping St pete
34:47
to prevent that army in St pete but it's fine it's fine i I guess it's fine so I
34:54
guess moving back how that was like a specific example but more generally what have you
35:01
liked about this game we have some great players like I mean nothing crazy from
35:07
my diplomacy like diplomatically I've only been outsmarted once and that was back in 1901 or 1902 when I tried to
35:14
convince everyone this is way at the start of the game um when I tried to convince everyone hey we should attack Austria and both the Turks and Italians
35:21
stabbed me and I almost lost everything on like the second move of the game or third move i forget which one it was but
35:28
um strategically everyone has surprised me in like the greatest ways possible the convoys the use of convoys has been
35:35
wonderful gabe had some wonderful attacks gabe and Seline had some great attacks on the in the Balkans that I
35:41
would have never seen coming i saw I saw the later ones coming because they were forced but those early attacks to get
35:47
back um Bulgaria and Budapest was great so really some great strategic gameplay
35:53
by everyone all right um do you have a question Ernest
36:00
um if presented with the opportunity to play Weebley Weeble
36:06
Diplo we guess
36:11
what would you I would in a heartbeat yeah this has
36:16
been great i I think the question wasn't like re continuing this game but No
36:21
would you play again like a different game a new game new game diplomacy
36:27
hm you see I would be I really would be interested to it would just have to be
36:33
like spaced out because I think everyone including me is burnt out a bit from diplomacy right it's a great It's only
36:39
natural it's only natural but I mean in my yearbook actually Jessica
36:45
signed it saying like uh she hates me for all the stress I've caused her in diplomacy
36:51
in like one month and I mean to a degree I could see it because I've like spent a lot of time thinking about this game and
36:59
like thinking how to win back centers and like maintain centers and I wouldn't say it's stressful but it does add like
37:07
anxiety if you know what I mean as any competitive game does i'm not sure why because you're playing for nothing but
37:13
Oh here here's how I do it i mean it just naturally does uhhuh here's here's how Yeah it's I mean like I think I
37:22
don't think that it's natural in my opinion i think that it's like cuz the way that I've dealt with it is that I
37:29
just take extended breaks in the game as in I just don't look at it during my
37:35
regular time i usually look at my diplomacy board in like the morning when I wake up and if I ever feel anxiety
37:41
about like oh what what the crap is Austria going to do to Romania i wish I
37:46
could do that no yeah I wish I could do that i would do it during lunch or something i'd do it at a different time and it kind of like offset that
37:53
circadian rhythm of me getting stressed I guess see I can't do that the way that
37:58
I deal with stuff like that is I just I take long extended breaks between games
38:06
like I don't play a game right after I play one like I take a really long time it's been a while since I've played a
38:12
game man i'm kind of itching to play one but all the people I want to play with don't want to play anymore because they're burnt out so I'm down to wait a
38:18
little bit more for sure i mean you could always do correspondence diplomacy which is so so long you just have to
38:25
send letters to each other to communicate i think if you want if we were to play I definitely think we could
38:31
do like a July correspondenceesque style diplomacy on B like instead of requiring
38:37
you guys as game masters if you guys do want to play which I hope you do I do um we could just put you guys or like set
38:44
up backstab or set up a webd instance and just like be the judge for us and I
38:50
think that would make it easier to put in moves and like not forget moves
38:55
because as evidence from you know personal mishaps with inputting
39:02
moves you know online means and typing them out it's a lot easier to just go on
39:07
Webdip because WebDip now has a super new advanced UI which is great and awesome and I wonder who made it whoever
39:13
made it is awesome he's plugging himself guys but like it's a lot easier I would say to use that UI than type in moves
39:20
because it's just a lot more intuitive and the same thing with backstabber it's a lot easier to just plug in your own moves i don't like I don't like the
39:26
combo command on webd because you don't like what i don't like the combo command the comic the convoy oh like the way it
39:35
looks or the way it the way it operates the way it operates in backstabber is actually different but that's a whole other discussion oh I I mean I only use
39:42
the web dip one but like I think it makes sense via convoy army the way the
39:48
way backstabber treats convoys you can take an army hostage with backstabber
39:55
and forcibly make it convoy when it doesn't order a convoy which is part of the game oh that's so interesting you
40:03
can't do it in web depos the here's the interesting bit like let's say in Black Sea here this
40:09
fleet wasn't yours right if Rum was moving to Bulgaria this Black
40:16
Sea fleet could convoy Rum to Bulgaria and you would be able to switch places even though Rum didn't order to be moved
40:23
through a convoy mhm meaning if they like wanted to bounce Sorry sorry if
40:29
they wanted to like Let's see let me imagine a situation where this is actually practically useful it's bar
40:35
it's rarely practical but it can happen sometimes and that's why I mean it's such a niche use case that if that were
40:41
to happen just like I don't know edit the game like yourself and like change
40:47
the placing of troops I suppose so we get we're getting too technical now
40:54
too much too much diplomacy tactic yeah i have I have I think a couple more
40:59
questions for you mhm you you mentioned that you played
41:05
diplomacy games before this one uhhuh how does this one compare to your previous ones it's the best one by far
41:11
cuz I won this one and I've lost a lot yeah well I mean you you won because we
41:17
declared you No yeah but I still feel like if we continued this game I would still be in I believe a crushing
41:24
position because I get to build I believe after this turn and I get to build Warsaw and build that supports
41:31
Moscow obviously yeah I think all of a sudden I'm I'm fine like I'm fine demanding presence in the north I'm fine
41:38
and in the south I'm fine as well because now Italy has backstabbed Austria and they are not on talking
41:44
terms anymore and you control Mun like you control Munich munich is like the mo probably the most important center in Oh
41:51
yeah yeah because that is the stalemate line right um all of a sudden like I
41:56
think if he continued I would still do fine the issue is yeah I don't know if everyone else will be able to rally
42:02
behind a stalemate line as evidenced by France repeatedly stabbing the Englishman but I mean I think I could
42:09
pull it off maybe perhaps who knows what would you say was your biggest mistake in this
42:16
game i still think it was 1902 the 1902 uh
42:22
spring I believe it was moves and look at Germany look at
42:27
Germany outside Warsaw i don't know how I talked my way out of this but somehow I
42:34
convinced them to not attack me and in doing so I gained a center too fall was great i I did great in fall but spring
42:41
was truly spring is spring is the Russ of course fall is right before winter
42:46
where Russia gains a huge advantage our moves have been pretty solid our
42:53
spring like Russian spring moves haven't been too great but it's actually reverse because
43:01
spring in spring you'd expect the Russians to have an advantage right but it seems to me that in spring it's
43:07
always people aggress they see Russia as less of a threat and then they leave
43:14
they leave him unattended to expand right okay i'm sorry we're we're kind of making this drag on longer than you
43:20
wanted it to but just a couple just a couple more questions i'm sorry i'm sorry for sure for sure
43:28
how did you Okay so actually kind of two questions packed into one how did you find diplomacy
43:35
and what is it about diplomacy that you like so much you do admit to me that I hate you Keenan i hate diplomacy but you
43:43
like it i don't know what is it about it that you like you know I've liked board games quite a
43:49
bit um my first actual decent board game was Risk Europe it's much better than
43:54
actual Risk risk Europe has like an economy system it's like Risk but it has
43:59
like an economy system and like specialized troops and all that and that was my first foray into actual more
44:04
advanced board games i'd always been used to Monopoly and Katan which are fine games don't get me wrong but I mean
44:10
Riskier Risk Risk it's a great risk Europe is super interesting you should look heard of that before i have a copy
44:16
of it actually i should have brought it in one day the issue is it's only four players so what not six it's crazy all
44:22
right six yeah go on go on yeah riskier was was my first foray into actual board
44:29
gaming I suppose as a hobby um and from there I began playing
44:35
um the Game of Thrones board game which is awesome oh that's so good well you recommended that to me Audrey yeah we
44:41
should play that i did game of Thrones board game is awesome it's like Diplomacy in that you have seven players all dying to kill each other and all
44:47
that or six players seven in the expansion um it's a lot more strategic in the sense that um it's difficult to
44:55
eliminate players entirely unless multiple players collude obviously and there's more of an element of I would
45:01
say skill and like actual battle tactics because you have like different commanders and all that to command your
45:07
troops but Game of Thrones was great um I never got into playing the Dune board
45:13
game but I I I watch started watching a bunch of YouTube videos of the Dune Board game which is really great yes are
45:18
you talking about Are you talking about the really old one that has like six factions that are not symmetrical that's the one i love that i love that yeah
45:25
i've never played it but I want to try it i want I would love to try it exactly a We should hang out over the summer we
45:32
should we really should when are you coming back to India man i'll come back in July tell you what I'll set up a day
45:37
where we can play Risk Europe because I I need a good risk squad yeah yeah yeah yeah i need a good risk her squad
45:43
because the issue is most board games require like decently skilled players to make it fun and without or like with
45:51
varying levels of skill it's just not fun right it really isn't well you mentioned okay sorry Ernest I I
46:00
want to get this down real quick you me you mentioned all these good board games what how'd you find diplomacy
46:07
n when you play these many dudes in a map board game when you play these many like war games naturally you find
46:14
diplomacy you like like diplomacy finds you you don't find diplomacy the game finds you right because once you get
46:20
into Dune and uh Game of Thrones and Risk Europe and like all these other massive large war games naturally you're
46:28
going to find the original you're going to want to find the game that kickstarted all of it i would say the
46:34
father of the the modern dudes in a map board game not being diplomacy and I got into this guy called Diplo Strats on
46:40
YouTube dude I love Dip Strat i love Diplo Strats too i love Diplo Strats and I thought yo it's kind of fun i should
46:45
play online and it's great to see that there's an actual community for this game because a lot of other board games
46:51
don't have massive online communities i don't think Dune has a massive online community like Diplomacy does and
46:58
luckily Diplomacy has this amazing community and like there's AI bots now you can play with too cicero for
47:04
instance if you guys have looked into that yeah I know it's I think that's a little bit ridiculous it's so cool and
47:10
it's just fun to play a game which is actively expanding and like diplomacy has like it's fun it's like a cross of
47:17
chess which I was super into as well as well as the games I love it's like a fun hybrid of the you know abstractness of
47:25
chess as chess I would say is so abstract now that it's difficult to enjoy for a newcomer because it's just
47:31
so like there's a massive skill ceiling but diplomacy is a lot more approachable it's so difficult and there like and
47:38
like chess there's different openings and there's different strategies and different tactics but that social
47:43
element is amazing and I love social board games too secret Hitler is awesome that you introduced us to that's awesome
47:50
um Avalon if you play that I think it's called Avalon i know I know Avalon yes
47:55
chances are if it's social deduction I know it too because I love that [ __ ] and diplomacy just combines dudes at a map
48:02
and social deduction perfectly it's great i love it what a game well if you
48:08
like social deduction you should do you should look into Town of Salem i love it oh oh no no no no no no no no don't look
48:13
at Dale don't look at Dale no no no i think I I think you work here no no no
48:19
the problem it's gotten so bad sorry what's happening what's been happening recently with I think is the meta is
48:26
there a meta in this game there is a meta basically Town of Salem is mafia
48:32
but everybody has a unique special ability that they use mhm like oh no I
48:38
think I have heard of this yeah the original Town of Salem one was really really good town of Salem 2 is just not
48:46
i just don't because they they like to be fairing a gamechanging role called the resurrectionist right the
48:52
retributionist the retri Sorry that's what I meant it could it could revive people and that it literally changes the
49:00
dynamic of the game but they like they completely nerfed it to something that
49:06
like you can use their abilities for like one night it was so stupid i was
49:12
like why are you I don't think that was stupid but it's We're getting so off topic i love it i
49:18
love it well I mean I could go on like they nerfed they nerfed investigator a little
49:25
bit i don't know how they changed it but I know they changed investigator in town too what's another thing
49:32
um oh yeah like the coven ones like it was a Yeah we're nerds we're nerds you
49:38
can get into it if you want but it's a whole meta you're going to have to learn it it's I don't think it's worth it yeah there's meta like apparently or take it
49:45
with a grain of salt obviously but like the meta and diplomacy for like top level board games now is the gang up on
49:51
Turkey because Italy needs centers and Italy like goes into eastern m and attacks Turkey like early game in
49:57
different games the reason the reason why people take out Turkey first is because if you let Turkey out it's
50:03
unstoppable oh yeah yeah which is why Italy needs to keep Turkey caged but
50:09
like there's a meta in diplomacy now as well right uh in the sense that of course it's a changing meta but
50:15
like you don't see openings like the Leonto anymore you don't see daring stuff anymore because which is a shame i
50:22
really don't like that it's so so sad if like in this this game was so dynamic
50:28
because everybody was basically new and everybody was trying their best to win that is when diplomacy is the best
50:36
where there's no meta there's no need to memorize or not memorize like go off of
50:41
predetermined you know theory which is it's fun to learn don't get me wrong but
50:47
like it ruins the game i guess Bobby Fischer was right when he was talking about chess and all that how theory
50:53
ruins chess and in the same vein theory ruins diplomacy but what do I know well theory doesn't I think Bobby Fischer's
51:01
he's he's talking from a point of a grandmaster he's talking from Oh yeah oh of course but like in high level
51:07
diplomacy you're going to see similar outcomes in the sense that it's likely going to be France or Russia winning
51:14
right the game and we you do see different outcomes obviously but you're
51:20
usually going to see Italy move into or move against um the Turk sometimes they
51:26
move against France it's rare but it happens they rarely go against Austria anymore because it just means their
51:32
downfall as well i don't know
51:37
see you know there is a way to get around that oddve and it's to explore
51:42
the vast community of diplomacy into different maps i've seen that the issue
51:50
is webd only supports the default map and I hate the web dip like default UI
51:57
like the like the overhauled UI is great therefore I play it but the old UI is
52:03
disgusting therefore don't look at it i'm talking there's Discord communities Discord bots stuff like that i actually
52:09
played me and Ernest have played our separate games in a 24 player variant that spann the entire world yeah it was
52:15
crazy there's like a whole new experience because there's like colonials versus uh regional powers it's
52:22
you should go check it out it's called um Imperial Diplomacy diplats has a
52:27
couple videos on it you can if you want to just watch it that's my homework for today and also like um Dibbleshhats he
52:33
played with another friend like in in the same country when they played like I think a fiveminute game of
52:40
