0:00
the way we're going to be doing this is
0:01
a little bit different than last time
0:03
Instead of talking about the current
0:05
state of the game and where your head is
0:07
at at that point because a lot has
0:09
happened and because you are no longer a
0:12
factor in the present we're going to be
0:15
like asking you how you are feeling like
0:17
on a seasonby season basis And we're
0:19
going to do that through me sharing my
0:21
screen right here
0:24
So uh
0:26
this this map right here is where we
0:30
left off uh with you in Romania and
0:34
Russians threatening to take it
0:37
back So
0:40
would you say that this is the year that
0:42
you misplayed hard like was there a huge
0:46
mistake that led to the downfall of
0:48
Turkey here
0:51
i would say that the biggest misplay
0:54
there was failed communication between
0:56
our
0:57
allies Um
1:00
we had plans to hold properly and we had
1:04
some support holds and taps planned
1:07
but at the last minute we came to the
1:10
realization that those hadn't actually
1:12
gone through This was the same day when
1:15
um Austria asked you if they can change
1:17
because our orders were still coming in
1:19
and they changed last minute Um and so
1:22
in that whole last minute hassle
1:25
communication was lost A few orders were
1:29
misordered and that yeah I think that
1:32
did end up being one of our most
1:34
critical downfalls
1:37
Oh if only right if only Budapest
1:40
support held Rum If only Greece did not
1:43
move into
1:44
Bulgaria Tiny mistakes like that The
1:46
Greece moving into Bulgaria was actually
1:49
our own call We we orchestrated that I'm
1:52
surprised that you didn't move
1:53
Constantinople into Bulgaria just to
1:56
like protect it
1:58
Uh my fear was that this was a round in
2:00
which territories were going to be
2:02
claimed and I was scared that odd was
2:04
going to try and move into
2:05
Constantinople and try to claim it if we
2:07
moved it out But if you moved
2:09
Constantinople into Bulgaria it would
2:11
have guaranteed bounce with
2:15
Greece and thus Greece would Bulgaria be
2:18
covered and Constantinople would never
2:20
move out of Constantinople
2:24
And that's what you get from experience
2:28
Yes there's always a next time if you
2:31
desire it Of course we should make this
2:34
an annual tradition with our team That'd
2:36
be that'd be crazy but that'd be also be
2:39
hard to organize I think Wait we should
2:41
make like a diplo variant where it's
2:43
like 20 people I mean I guess that could
2:47
work but we'll have to wait and see how
2:49
everyone feels cuz like this game could
2:51
scar some people and you can easily get
2:53
burnt out Here's an idea Kenan A giant
2:55
diplomacy map that's just a grid with
2:57
like one giant province That's boring
3:00
You circle It's it's grids but you have
3:04
great sea provinces in between that like
3:08
multiple people can go in and then like
3:10
we just see how that goes
3:12
Well I mean aside from your
3:17
predicament do you think that there is
3:19
anything else to comment on on this
3:21
board baga
3:24
Oh Russia's sweeps have been crazy They
3:27
have been playing this game well
3:30
um they've been backstabbed so many
3:32
times yet they found a way to come out
3:34
on top every single time So even though
3:37
I don't want them to win if there is a
3:39
candidate who I think is most worthy of
3:41
the win with the way they've been
3:42
playing it's definitely Russia What do
3:44
you think has uh caused Russia to like
3:49
what do how what do you think gives
3:52
Russia that edge to come back even
3:54
though they seem to always be in a
3:56
position where they're about to lose big
3:59
i mean they're completely unpredictable
4:01
Like everyone knows that they can't
4:03
trust
4:04
them but then they're still everyone is
4:08
still partnering with them and they are
4:11
going to execute on one of those plans
4:14
And each round they pick a different
4:16
person to partner with and actually
4:18
truly work with other than France
4:19
They've been consistently allied with
4:21
France
4:23
But beyond that it's been interesting to
4:26
try to
4:28
see which of their lies are actually
4:31
truth
4:34
I see Do you have any feelings towards
4:37
the fall of Germany which coincidentally
4:40
seems to start to happen just as you
4:42
were falling
4:44
i mean we didn't engage too much with
4:45
Germany They we were planning to um if
4:49
the whole hold on Romania had gone well
4:52
we were planning to expand northwards
4:54
and then us Austria and Germany were
4:56
going to work together to take out
4:57
Russia
4:59
Clearly that didn't work out too well
5:03
Um cursed are those who turn against the
5:06
Russians
5:07
Yeah
5:09
Yeah I don't know Yeah It's definitely
5:13
unfortunate that both of us have gone
5:14
out at the same time but at least now we
5:17
don't we're not necessarily the first
5:18
ones out you know it's not just Turkey
5:20
You were out on the first you're you
5:22
were out on the same turn as Germany so
5:24
I don't know what you're talking about
5:28
If it was just us then it would have
5:29
been like "Oh Turkeyy's first turn out."
5:31
But now it's like we're going out in
5:32
waves you know uhhuh I see All right
5:36
we're going to move on to the next um
5:40
the next season right here And you
5:43
decide to destroy the army in Smyrna and
5:47
keep the army in Galatia What was the
5:50
philosophy behind that uh two main
5:53
thought processes One oddly asked me to
5:56
destroy the one in
5:57
Galatia and like Oh and you just wanted
5:59
to piss him off Yeah like especially
6:03
after that last round like I was pissed
6:06
and I was like yeah I'm not following
6:07
what odd is telling me to do and then
6:10
that more than just tried to piss off I
6:12
think the other thought process was at
6:14
this point we were kind of starting to
6:15
see that we weren't going to last too
6:17
long and our goal was to deteriorate
6:19
Russia as much as we can potentially
6:20
find a way to get back into Romania and
6:22
take that from their
6:24
control and so having that troop in
6:26
Galatia had the ability to act as an
6:31
offensive troop especially moved into
6:32
Ukraine or
6:34
um like anything of that sort it would
6:37
give us a little bit of a playing field
6:39
to work with The only downside to that
6:42
is that did mean that our home bases
6:45
were completely unprotected which we saw
6:48
the effects of in the next turn Do you
6:50
think that it's better to give up or
6:55
fight to see another day do you think
6:57
that if if things were different that
6:59
you would have been willing to commit
7:02
yourself
7:03
to a like a very very dragged out
7:08
fight i think I would have been down for
7:11
that under two premises
7:16
One our alliance was working out a
7:19
little
7:20
better cuz the alliance was tight
7:24
Everyone was being honest with each
7:25
other and that was working out Like no
7:27
one lied throughout that whole alliance
7:28
which is
7:30
surprising but in effect it didn't work
7:34
out great for
7:35
us
7:40
And the thought process by then was just
7:43
that a slight
7:46
burnout
7:50
B like we could have tried dragging it
7:53
out with two troops It would mostly just
7:54
been holding cuz Russia surrounded us
7:57
and then eventually Austria would agree
8:00
too
8:01
Um and so like we could have held for a
8:04
bit found a way to maybe gain one troop
8:07
in like four different seasons and
8:10
then try building again but based on the
8:14
amount of troops everyone else had it it
8:16
wasn't seeming likely that we would win
8:17
So our thought process after this point
8:19
was just okay we're screwed How can we
8:22
help Austria because they've been loyal
8:25
allies We will devote our troops instead
8:26
of letting Russia take as many of them
8:28
as possible at least have Austria take
8:30
them under So really it comes down to
8:33
whether or not fighting is worth it And
8:37
you know I I'll bring in a very special
8:39
case Um in one of the finals for like a
8:44
diplomacy tournament
8:47
um a lot of people were in contention to
8:49
win It was like a team- based thing and
8:52
several teams needed their own
8:54
respective solo and one team needed a
8:57
draw It was a very high stakes game and
9:00
for that reason because it was high
9:01
stakes it was worth it The idea that you
9:04
had your whole team on your back and
9:06
they were depending on you is what got a
9:08
lot of people like fired up to keep
9:10
going And it's the reason why a couple
9:14
like in fact two players who were on one
9:17
center managed to come back and one of
9:20
those players managed to win
9:23
Really yes it is possible Yes it is That
9:27
person was Italy I'm pretty sure that
9:29
person was Italy and the game lasted
9:30
three real life years
9:33
Yeah Yeah I Wait I watched that same
9:36
video I'll explain Yeah it it it was
9:38
ridiculous Legend they forgot about the
9:40
event too They were like "Okay." Yeah
9:42
And the the the next years had to be
9:44
cancelled because like this the current
9:46
year was still going on you know but
9:49
like it goes to show that any
9:52
position through enough grit and
9:54
determination enough sweat blood and
9:56
tears is able to be salvaged At least
9:59
that's my thought
10:00
process So to be fair we also didn't
10:03
have that much time left in the year
10:04
Yeah this is true This is true Yeah So I
10:07
mean it's just a friendly game It's just
10:09
a friendly game but the game can be
10:12
vicious It can be legendary And
10:15
who knows it's going to be great It's
10:16
going to be great
10:19
So I mean I don't think there's much
10:21
else to comment on How about we move on
10:23
to the next phase where things are a bit
10:25
interesting actually So here right here
10:28
explain what do you think happened
10:31
um let me try and remember what happened
10:34
here Austria here in case you're
10:36
confused supported rum to hold
10:42
They did not support your attack and
10:44
thus it failed
10:48
Did Oh so there might have been a
10:50
betrayal
10:55
You didn't realize this until now i
10:58
thought this was something you were born
10:59
The way they phrased it was instead of
11:03
support moving we wrote support hold
11:05
because we didn't realize there was a
11:07
difference which I assumed was a blunder
11:12
Do you think they're telling the truth
11:16
don't you have to say that you are
11:18
support hold
11:20
no you have to say who which move you're
11:23
helping with You would have to say with
11:24
Galishia right yeah You they Whereas in
11:27
a support hold you would just say
11:28
support holding the Romanian Yeah
11:32
Oh so that was not a blunder There is no
11:34
way that's a
11:39
blunder
11:41
Oh you know what that's interesting
11:45
That just clicked for me Do you think
11:48
it's a blunder or do you think they're
11:50
being honest it's definitely not a
11:51
blunder
11:54
I think by this point they saw
11:58
that all
12:01
those
12:06
Austrians Oh the effects of you got
12:10
stabbed and then now the effects of the
12:12
stab start the show It's like one of
12:14
those like animes where he
12:16
goes and like 10 seconds later the guy
12:19
like starts like slip like the front
12:21
half Yeah I get what you're talking
12:23
about Yeah I like I have the scene in my
12:25
head right now like the exact
12:26
visualization
12:30
Yeah If you Okay so you think now that
12:34
they stabbed you if you thought that
12:36
before would that have changed your
12:37
actions in this game
12:41
i would have probably sacrificed our
12:43
territory to Russia instead of
12:46
them but I don't think it would have
12:50
changed in any sort of recovery method
12:52
Like I don't think that would have
12:54
helped
12:57
us Could it have helped us
13:06
um potentially cuz we could have gone in
13:09
for Greece from the Adrien instead of
13:11
holding Constantinople and moving into
13:14
Anchora There's always that scenario
13:17
where you think of what could have
13:18
happened in the past but it is too late
13:21
What is in the past has
13:23
passed and now we are only left with the
13:26
present of the future of everything else
13:29
whatever Okay Kenan stop being
13:31
philosophical Yeah I'm Miss Zone guys
13:33
I'm the new Missone Keenan Unit one
13:36
Kenan That'd be sick
13:38
honestly
13:40
So it appears that we have been reveal
13:42
we have revealed a couple new things but
13:44
there is still a little bit more that we
13:45
need to get through Baguia So moving on
13:49
to the next phase This is the
13:51
interesting one because I think this is
13:53
a very interesting face because Galatia
13:55
is moving into
13:57
Budapest for some reason and Armenia is
14:00
moving to
14:01
Smura while all of a remember what the
14:04
thought process of moving into Budapest
14:06
was
14:08
uh did Russia try and convince you that
14:10
they'd support you in Oh yeah that's
14:13
what
14:14
happened They said that they'd help us
14:16
get Budapest And at that point like it
14:19
didn't really
14:24
matter Oh Oh Oh I remember this one So
14:29
Duva and I had a big disagreement on
14:30
this one Um Duva was sort of on to Gabe
14:34
in that last round He thought that Gabe
14:36
was betraying
14:38
us I hadn't actually been there for that
14:41
last round and so I didn't know the
14:42
details of the
14:43
order And so I thought that like it was
14:47
probably just a
14:48
blunder Um and so I was asking to work
14:52
with Gabe or
14:54
Austria Drew wanted to work with Romania
14:56
or not Russia Russia that's the one
15:01
Um and so I even if I was considering
15:06
the possibility
15:08
of
15:11
Austria taking like actually trying to
15:14
betray us I would still rather go with
15:17
Austria and know that they're doing this
15:20
than try to go with Russia because
15:21
Russia's been unpredictable Like there's
15:22
no way to trust what Russia's saying But
15:25
like Austria we could still sort of
15:28
figure out I guess it's the lesser of
15:32
two evils
15:33
Yeah I wanted to stick with Austria but
15:37
um for the primary reason we ended up
15:39
going with the Russia side is
15:43
Austria blatantly claimed that they
15:45
weren't going to turn in orders to just
15:48
hold all
15:49
territories And this was like a minute
15:51
before This was the time we walked up to
15:52
you and gave our orders verbally Mhm And
15:55
so this was literally like last minute
15:58
like maybe we could talk about that That
16:02
that seems like a last minute habit of
16:03
yours We could talk about that later
16:05
What speaking of which what are your
16:07
thoughts on Austria holding all units
16:08
here why do you think they did it and
16:11
was that the sole reason why you moved
16:13
into Budapest
16:18
i mean it was
16:20
definitely a reason I suppose Um though
16:24
I do think at this stage in the game it
16:26
would have been a much smarter move to
16:27
go into
16:28
Vienna if we did know that they were
16:31
just going to hold
16:37
This is also the one that would have
16:38
gotten us the territory right huh yeah
16:40
This was this was a this was a fall turn
16:49
I think part of the reason we decided
16:50
Budapest is so that we could have that
16:52
theoretical alliance with Russia and
16:53
have maybe a chance of getting back but
16:56
I don't know I was iffy on that since
16:58
the start Um wishful thinking Yeah
17:01
Vienna probably would have been the best
17:03
play there
17:05
Oh man As for Austria doing all holds I
17:08
have no clue why they did that other
17:10
than the fact that to be fair they were
17:12
surrounded on all fronts Um they
17:15
couldn't really trust Germany cuz they
17:16
were in contention with against or
17:18
against them Russia was right there
17:22
Um I
17:24
mean us was we weren't really doing
17:27
anything against them until this point
17:29
but they clearly had just gone against
17:32
us in that last
17:33
round and so they could have been
17:35
fearing that we might have realized
17:38
Well this unfortunate this uh did you
17:43
were you uh considering that the army
17:45
and Armenia would move to Sperna or were
17:48
you No that was just a complete like
17:50
miss from our part Yeah Well cuz he was
17:53
threatening Anchora
17:56
and I forgot that it was a mind games
18:01
Yeah you got you got to protect Ankora
18:03
I'mma go for Smyrna secretly That's very
18:06
smart of him
18:09
Yeah
18:12
Let's move on to the next phase where
18:14
again you tried you decide to keep the
18:16
army in Galatia and destroy a unit at
18:19
home Do you think this was for similar
18:21
reasons as last time or were they
18:23
different i this time it was quite
18:26
literally solely to piss
18:28
off cuz by this point we were like okay
18:31
no we are out of the game like it does
18:32
not
18:33
matter I want to piss hot off as much as
18:35
I can
18:38
Well do you think that you ever
18:40
succeeded in that
18:42
yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah He got he got really
18:44
frustrated that Kichio was still there
18:46
It didn't make an impact but it pissed
18:47
him off a little
18:50
Yeah Especially because now rum can be
18:53
targeted very easily by Bud Serbia and
18:56
Galatia which is in fact what you guys
18:59
chose to do Oh did we at this point we
19:02
had given up and we were copy pasting
19:03
orders sent to us by Austria though Oh
19:05
no You became what's it called earnest
19:09
when they are a vassal state You became
19:12
a vassel state man We most definitely
19:14
did Yeah
19:16
And this is not a decision you regret Am
19:19
I right no No By this point we were
19:22
ready to sacrifice ourselves to Austria
19:24
because it was just either sacrifice to
19:26
Austria
19:27
or let Russia have our remnants And uh
19:33
like I mentioned in that last turn was
19:35
not about to let Russia take more Oh boy
19:38
But they were the ones who got
19:40
away with I believe both of your centers
19:43
by the end of this year So hey I do
19:46
think they did Yeah So I mean like I
19:50
guess was it all worth it in the end
19:53
throwing away your life just to have
19:54
Russia take all of your home centers
19:57
clearly not
20:00
Well we are now at the present and I
20:05
think arguably this is a time to reflect
20:09
What is one thing that you think you
20:11
could have done better and what was the
20:13
one thing that led to your downfall
20:19
AP testing
20:23
oh man I'm sorry about that man I'm
20:25
sorry Yeah cuz honestly like half the
20:29
reason that we were doing everything
20:30
like last minute is cuz like it wasn't
20:31
on our minds until we were there
20:34
and then well to be fair we were getting
20:37
cooked in the previous rounds too So I
20:38
don't think that's just AP testing I
20:39
think that's [ __ ]
20:41
Um I don't know I think probably just
20:44
first time playing didn't fully
20:46
understand the strategy and how things
20:47
worked Like early on there was a big
20:50
blunder in like the first couple moves
20:52
and like the impact of that was like
20:54
showing till our end Um and I think that
20:58
was like that was just like a confusion
20:59
on the rules from our part And so I
21:02
think part of it was just beginner's
21:04
luck in negative direction Beginners bad
21:08
luck maybe Yeah If given the chance
21:11
would you play diplomacy again oh of
21:15
course I'm very glad that you you'd say
21:17
that
21:19
Um but aside from the AP testing cuz
21:23
like that is a that is a variable that
21:25
is outside of your control at least in
21:28
the context of this game
21:31
like maybe it was the fact that you
21:33
didn't have enough time to dedicate to
21:34
this And for that I I apologize Maybe I
21:37
should And for But what like like
21:42
strictly speaking of the game do you
21:44
think was the biggest mistake you made
21:53
two one that move in which we didn't go
21:56
into Vienna and tried going into
21:57
Budapest Mhm And then the other I want
22:02
to say it's the second move we were
22:04
splitting territories in the Balkans
22:06
with Austria
22:08
Yeah Um and okay our thought process was
22:11
we would get Bulgaria and Serbia so that
22:13
if we didn't end up allying with Austria
22:15
we would have the opportunity to go into
22:17
Greece and it would kind of corner it
22:19
off However this and then this is the
22:21
point where I was talking about um there
22:23
was a misunderstanding in the rules for
22:25
us Um didn't work out as planned So we
22:28
ended up switching up They got Serbia
22:31
and Greece and we only got Bulgaria that
22:34
round Um so that put us at a deficit
22:37
since the start and then to make up for
22:39
that we tried going into Romania and
22:42
then the Romanian tales have been
22:44
everpresent in all of our moves since
22:46
then But it's the new Viet it's it's the
22:48
Turkish Vietnam Turkish Vietnam Oh yeah
22:55
So if you were to play this again what
22:58
do you think you would do differently
23:07
i understand the rules better
23:10
Oh well you're you're hurting me with
23:12
this one I feel like No you explained it
23:15
well I just didn't like fully think
23:16
through it Like I think if I had the
23:18
simulation up and tried running it a
23:20
couple of times the sandbox myself Oh we
23:22
should have just said to do that as Yeah
23:25
man Well yeah Look it's not just it's
23:29
not just mistakes Baga makes mistake we
23:31
make when we when we're talking when we
23:33
find out what we're doing here No to be
23:35
honest like I don't think you guys have
23:37
could have led this any better Like
23:41
for me it was a great experience I'm
23:43
very glad it was a good experience for
23:44
you I mean I I'm glad that you have this
23:48
takeaway that you want to play again Um
23:51
what was it about diplomacy that has got
23:54
you so interested in it
24:02
do you know how when we're playing poker
24:04
Oddbe is always like one more dollar one
24:07
more dollar $1,1
24:10
With that but with territories and in
24:12
negotiations and trying to figure
24:13
everything out trying to play like it's
24:15
the whole idea of in poker you're trying
24:17
to play the man not the like cards right
24:19
in the same way the strategies are
24:20
really not based
24:22
on places or moves It's It's a lot more
24:25
based on who you can trust And that
24:29
whole psychological war part of the game
24:33
was really fun I'm I'm very glad that
24:35
you thought that way
24:38
Uh Ernest I'm glad that you introduced
24:40
