0:00
hello Adve how are you today wonderful
0:03
wonderful so a lot has happened over
0:07
this week so I think we're going to
0:09
change up the format instead of you know
0:11
just like asking questions about the
0:13
current board state I'm going to ask you
0:15
you like your overall thought process
0:17
throughout the years throughout the
0:18
turns throughout the season and in order
0:20
to better illustrate that I'm actually
0:23
sharing this on another monitor of mine
0:25
so you can have Yeah incredible
0:28
ingenious the greatest thing anyone has
0:30
ever done mhm so um do you have any
0:34
thoughts like actually no never mind
0:37
never mind let me restart like do you
0:39
have any uh objections just starting
0:41
right now or should we wait for a couple
0:43
of years we can start now no it's fine
0:44
i'll have to leave actually pretty soon
0:46
in like 20ish minutes I think so I hope
0:49
that's fine okay well yeah let's just
0:50
we'll just need to speedrun it then what
0:52
were your thoughts uh up in the north
0:54
here it seems like you had a little bit
0:57
of something going on here denmark is
0:58
supporting the Baltic Sea into Sweden
1:00
and the North Sea is attacking Denmark
1:03
did you propose like deals to both of
1:06
them to try and attack the other or was
1:08
there something else going on kind of
1:10
that was most just stabs honestly
1:12
because at this point in
1:14
time the Russians had been pushed up
1:17
against a wall we lost Romania we lost
1:19
Sweden right and Germany of course was
1:22
about to take Warsaw next turn right so
1:25
I proposed to the Germans hey if you
1:26
don't take Warsaw I wouldn't take Kio
1:29
obviously I didn't do that but um again
1:32
I was pushed up against the wall right
1:34
it's a shame I had to lie a bit truly
1:36
but it is what it is i was initially
1:38
going to take Norway anyways that was
1:41
what England offered to us they said "If
1:44
you help us into Denmark um we'll let
1:47
you guys uh take Norway or take Sweden
1:49
back." We didn't help them take Denmark
1:51
we took Ke anyways but we helped them
1:54
indirectly by taking away a German army
1:56
so really it was support of some kind is
1:59
that really
2:01
Is that really a winning strategy just
2:03
stab and like dis ignore all your deals
2:06
that you're making not really no but
2:08
then Okay in my defense especially the
2:09
fact that both of them followed through
2:10
on their side of the deal they did the
2:13
issue is the last time we did follow
2:15
through with our promises we got stabbed
2:18
really badly on both fronts and the
2:20
English did stab us too right they did
2:22
take Sweden from us when we asked them
2:24
not to so I would say it was fair i mean
2:26
I would have preferred not to stab but
2:28
we had three powers four powers actually
2:31
come against us the Germans the English
2:33
the Turks and the Austrians right so um
2:38
this seat was really the last trick we
2:39
had so how about down in the south in
2:43
the on the I'm surprised that worked in
2:45
the first place the Turkish player I'm
2:48
sure has been doing great diplomatic
2:50
work but their strategic play hasn't
2:52
been the greatest right okay unfort like
2:56
leaving Bulgaria unoccupied right that
2:58
they should have backfield Bulgaria um
3:00
and taking Eastern Man instead of Aene
3:02
in the first place um I feel like they
3:05
could have played that better because I
3:07
should not have taken Romania back right
3:10
yeah what was up with this uh Greece
3:12
move to Bulgaria
3:14
that was just Austria stabbing Turkey um
3:17
because I had convince Austria that hey
3:19
Bulgaria is open take Bulgaria right um
3:22
I was surprised that they didn't even
3:24
try to bounce in con that Serbia just
3:27
but like I'd assume it was pre-arranged
3:29
to some degree but I'm also not sure to
3:31
what degree the Austrians and Turks have
3:33
been working together because Budapest
3:35
if Budapest chose to hold Romania could
3:37
have prevented me from taking Romania in
3:38
the first place but Budapest critically
3:41
was just open right or like it held so
3:45
clearly there
3:46
was some backstabbing happening by the
3:49
Austrians against the Turks anyways do
3:51
you see anything that you would have
3:54
wished to have played differently in
3:56
this season
3:57
i wish I didn't go to Warsaw and I wish
3:59
I stuck in GIA with that troop because I
4:02
allowed um Turkey to back fill into GIA
4:05
through a retreat and that Turkish troop
4:07
in Gia has been a real pain i hate that
4:09
i wish um I didn't I I kept that GSIA
4:12
troop in Gaussia and then built in
4:14
Warsaw the next year yeah all right
4:17
let's move on to the next next phase
4:20
obviously you built a army in Moscow um
4:23
what was the philosophy behind that and
4:25
not an army in St pete or fleet in St
4:27
pete the idea was that if I did build an
4:30
ar I could have built army in St pete
4:32
but I needed army Moscow just to
4:35
reaffirm against that Gian threat down
4:37
here um the issue with Army St pete is
4:40
that I knew that England was going to
4:41
build a fleet in Edinburgh anyways and
4:43
if they really wanted to they could take
4:45
Norway back by just going to Norwegian
4:47
and I would have two against three three
4:49
wins so my idea was from now on now
4:51
we'll be a good teammate to my English
4:53
friends and support them as I did next
4:56
turn in next turn I supported England
4:58
into Holland and then I supported
4:59
England to KE to I think a turn after
5:01
that so really I was just trying to
5:05
ensure that I from now on actually
5:07
upheld my promises to regain some
5:09
semblance of trust would you say that
5:11
this marks a turning point in your area
5:14
of focus like no longer are you going to
5:16
be focusing too much in the west but you
5:18
would rather focused in the south the
5:20
eastern part of the board kind of i mean
5:22
I was still interested in the fall of
5:24
Germany because those German centers
5:26
were delicious right amazing and the
5:28
entire board fell upon them too really a
5:30
shame for the Germans but um I did want
5:33
some of those German centers i'm still
5:34
planning on trying to fight for Berlin
5:36
and maybe even Munich with the help of
5:38
the Frenchmen um because those German
5:41
centers would prove pivotal not only for
5:42
me but for Austria and Austria is our
5:45
biggest um adversary now in this later
5:48
stage of the game so I am still focused
5:50
on the West but of course the Russians
5:53
will always have a keen interest in the
5:55
Balkan side of things all right how
5:57
about let's move on to the next phase
5:59
over here as you could see it looks like
6:02
the Germans were not too friendly on the
6:04
fact that you took Keel no no they were
6:07
quite upset at that thought which I
6:08
found interesting because everyone
6:11
stabbed them and they really latched on
6:12
to our stabbing it was mostly because we
6:15
promised to help the Germans and we
6:16
didn't so I I I can see it but yeah they
6:19
weren't happy about that but we took
6:20
Berlin anyways ke was not going to be
6:23
held for very long i mean I knew Keel
6:25
was going to fall anyways so um us being
6:28
kicked to Berlin was sooner rather than
6:30
later but it was inevitable anyways ke
6:32
was just not going to be possible to
6:34
hold it seems at this point that you're
6:36
no longer in the horrible position you
6:39
were in by the end of last week no it is
6:42
more it is better it is still dangerous
6:44
but it is better the Austrian still has
6:46
a tight grip over us obviously what
6:48
would you attribute this uh reversal in
6:50
status to
6:52
i'm honestly not sure i really I'm
6:54
really not um the main reason is that we
6:57
had so many we were able to maintain all
6:59
of our build didn't even gain one so it
7:01
was difficult to launch appropriate
7:02
stabs and the Austrian was or the
7:06
Frenchman and I convinced the Austrian
7:07
to attack the Italian now because this
7:09
was before Italy had taken Spain so
7:12
Italy was in a quite weak state right
7:14
now um and so as you can see with
7:16
Austria they move they pivoted towards
7:18
Venice instead of uh us instead of
7:21
Romania unfortunately that changed this
7:24
turn but it was just us convincing
7:26
others that hey we're not your biggest
7:28
enemy the the Italians are for instance
7:30
or the Germans are or someone else right
7:32
what tools did you use to convince
7:34
Austria to move into Venice it was um
7:37
support but so the Frenchman played a
7:38
major role in convincing Austria to move
7:40
against Italy because the Frenchman
7:41
promised everything if the Italian or if
7:44
the Austrian was to stab Italy so it
7:47
wasn't us as much we just played a that
7:50
hey we wouldn't attack you if you don't
7:52
attack us and move for Italy instead
7:54
that was it
7:56
all right um so tactics wise down here
8:00
would you say that you played it quite
8:01
well and were you also the reason why
8:04
Austria supported Rum to hold
8:08
i mean that was just a gift it was
8:10
necessary because Turkey couldn't take
8:12
Rum by itself it needed Austrian support
8:15
and we were going to move against Turkey
8:16
anyways we had told Austria that hey if
8:18
you don't move against us in Rome we
8:19
will take out Turkey for you and we did
8:21
that we delivered on the promise we
8:22
moved Seb down to Armenia and the Turk
8:25
is now on one sent I believe do you
8:28
think that you will uh practice in
8:30
deceit again like you did with Germany
8:33
and England uh against two against the
8:35
Austrian yeah against I mean the
8:39
Austrian and I can only maintain a
8:41
relationship for so long they are now
8:42
the dominant power in the Balkans and as
8:44
such it will be the responsibility of us
8:47
the Russians to counteract that
8:48
dominance right do you think that you
8:50
could get support from Italy against the
8:55
Austrians the issue is the Italians have
8:58
succeeded in breaking down the French
9:00
defenses and so the Italians will gorge
9:02
themselves upon the French centers upon
9:04
those upon the Portuguese and Spanish
9:06
centers right
9:08
so I can't really count on Italian help
9:11
just now i'll have to you know hold down
9:13
what I have and maintain my current
9:15
centers until the Italians have finished
9:18
taking over the French because the
9:19
French will unfortunately fall soon
9:21
because England and Italy are both
9:23
looking very um greedily at their
9:26
centers and upon the demise of the
9:28
French I can then count upon Italian
9:30
support against the Austrians
9:32
well you did mention earlier that
9:34
England is like he they could take uh
9:38
Norway at any point whenever they wanted
9:40
to does that worry you are you worried
9:42
that the English will turn on you and go
9:45
for Norway go for St petersburg i mean
9:48
I'm surprised they haven't done it
9:49
already if it was me playing the English
9:51
I would have taken Norway probably last
9:53
turn or I would take it this turn on the
9:55
the upcoming turn and it is a very
9:57
likely possibility but if they were to
10:00
take Norway it's not that big a deal
10:01
because I have an army in St pete now so
10:03
I can just dissolve that uh fleet in
10:05
Norway if push come to shove and
10:07
hopefully that'll keep the English uh
10:10
pacified i would love English support
10:13
against the Italians to counteract
10:15
Italian dominance in France so I believe
10:18
that the English will just go for the uh
10:21
northernmost French centers and in turn
10:23
prevent the Italians from taking too
10:25
many of the French holdings so correct
10:26
me if I'm wrong but in this in this
10:29
phase of the game spring 1903 your
10:32
relationship with the Turks is not that
10:34
good right it's hostile it's it's
10:37
actively hostile do you think there's
10:39
any benefit in like in do you think
10:42
there was any benefit in perhaps working
10:44
with them
10:46
the issue is I've tried working with the
10:48
Turk as evidenced by my first move and
10:51
it didn't work well right because the
10:52
Turks for some reason h and I was
10:54
looking at previous moves too but the
10:56
Turks and the Austrians have had a far
10:57
closer relationship than I have had
10:59
because even dating back to I think fall
11:01
of 1901 I believe the Austrians and the
11:04
Turks made a deal where the Austrians
11:06
said "I'll go into Romania and you can
11:07
take Serbia." So clearly the Austrians
11:10
and Turks have had a far close
11:11
relationship so me working with the Turk
11:14
always has that degree of distrust and I
11:16
don't know if I can trust them um I did
11:18
at one point convince the Turks to
11:20
attack Austria instead of me but I
11:22
didn't support them and that was
11:23
probably a blunder i should have
11:24
supported the Turks into Austria um was
11:26
that next turn that was next turn I
11:29
believe yeah yeah right there i told the
11:31
Turks "Hey from Romania I'll support you
11:32
into Budapest." I didn't because I
11:35
thought that the Turks weren't going to
11:36
do that because they've had a history of
11:38
just not doing what they say right uh
11:40
Baga for instance loves to tell me moves
11:43
that he's going to do and doesn't
11:44
actually do them and it got me the first
11:46
two times and then by the third time
11:48
around I refused to believe it even
11:49
though he actually did carry it out so
11:51
that's one of the issues with working
11:52
with the Turks they have had this
11:54
tendency to lie so much to me at least
11:57
that I can't trust them at their word
11:58
and as a result I had to take Turkey or
12:01
the Turkish centers so what are your
12:03
thoughts on Austria holding all units
12:05
during this phase
12:08
a shame i really think they could have
12:10
gone for Italy right there if the
12:11
Austrians had fought against Italy it
12:13
would make life for me a lot easier and
12:15
would have helped my French ally as well
12:18
so I did find it upsetting but I mean it
12:22
is what it is i do think it was a
12:24
blunder by the Austrians the Austrians
12:25
definitely could have taken Venice or
12:27
Munich this turn and gotten a build um
12:30
but I suppose they saw some benefit to
12:32
not growing fast and there is there is
12:35
something in that as well let's say they
12:37
did take Venice let's say they did take
12:39
Munich how would that be good for you
12:41
when all those centers would just
12:43
translate into builds back in Vienna so
12:47
if they were to take Venice there's a
12:48
build now in Vienna or Triest if they
12:50
took Venice I would I would wager it be
12:52
a build in Triest just because they've
12:54
now got the Italians to fight against
12:56
them right and with the Italians because
12:58
the Italians would want Venice back
13:00
inevitably right so now they have a war
13:03
on two fronts and this is far better for
13:05
me the Russian because the Russian has
13:06
no enemies to the east i am the east
13:08
right
13:11
oh wow don't let your head get too big
13:14
well no i mean no no no i'm not saying
13:17
I'm the east as in like there's no
13:19
eastern enemy to go against me like when
13:22
you look at the east of the board it's
13:23
just Russia right like literally it's St
13:26
pete Moscow and Sebast right there's
13:28
Turkey too but Turkeykey's now a dying
13:30
power it's a stick man of Europe um they
13:33
are going to die soon too so I really
13:36
wish the Austrians would have attacked
13:37
Italy because that way we would had the
13:38
Italians on one side the Russians on the
13:40
other and it makes a very nice Austrian
13:42
sandwich in between
13:47
so we haven't talked about the French
13:50
that much yet do you think that there is
13:52
a way for them to successfully fend off
13:54
this Italian attack and also what are
13:57
your thoughts on them moving into
13:59
Belgium this turn
14:01
i mean they that was agreed upon like
14:04
the the entire idea was that I'd keep
14:06
Berlin and that the the English get
14:09
Denmark and in return the French will
14:11
get Belgium back and that worked that
14:14
was great because that means the French
14:15
don't lose the build to Spain but France
14:20
now is in too weak of a situation to
14:21
continue i mean the English for instance
14:25
have been looking at uh breast for quite
14:28
some time and they will take it most
14:30
likely and the French are even open to
14:32
that like Sean himself told me and told
14:34
the English players that if he wanted to
14:36
take my centers that's fine because he's
14:38
going to go down fighting against the
14:40
Italians so it like France just can't
14:44
support itself against this massive
14:46
England england too is scary now england
14:48
has gained so many centers that they are
14:50
terrifying well okay if that's the case
14:53
then wouldn't it wouldn't France be an
14:56
even greater ally or help to you
14:59
attacking England together
15:02
i would have loved that but Shawn
15:03
wouldn't listen to it right because
15:04
England has been nice to Shawn at least
15:07
for now um and as the result Shawn feels
15:10
that it's his duty he has this misplaced
15:12
sense of duty I feel which doesn't exist
15:14
in a game like this there is no honor in
15:16
this game right you you simply look out
15:18
for yourself but
15:21
unfortuned up his centers to the English
15:24
so Jean just wouldn't move against the
15:26
English which I which is a shame for me
15:28
because the English are my dominant
15:30
adversary up in Scandinavia but it is
15:34
what it is right we play the hangord out
15:36
all right let's move on to the next
15:38
phase
15:40
here you decided to build an army in St
15:43
pete army St pete yeah that was just to
15:45
support my Scandinavian holdings because
15:48
I didn't expect to get Smyrna smyrna was
15:50
probably just luck for me um it was
15:52
50-50 either I go for Ankara or they
15:54
bounced me in Smyrna i guessed right and
15:56
so I got it
16:00
uh but as you did say before the the the
16:05
fact that England can just take Norway
16:07
and the army and St pete won't be doing
16:09
much to protect it like do you think
16:12
that it was a mistake or do you think
16:15
that this was a correct choice in build
16:18
what I should have done is I blundered i
16:21
should have gone to Finland next turn i
16:24
for some reason I hold from St pete to
16:26
Norway um in the next turn I should have
16:28
gone to Finland because now I have an
16:29
actual threat against Sweden because
16:31
Denmark has moved down south so I'm
16:33
still trying to convince the English to
16:36
hold off on capturing Norway just so I
16:38
can position my St pete army to Finland
16:40
so I can then relocate Norway over to
16:42
Sweden which is far harder for the
16:43
English to displace speaking about this
16:45
next phase it seems like a lot has
16:48
happened especially down here truly a
16:51
shame i mean I didn't expect it romania
16:53
was never mine to keep for long with
16:55
this massive Austrian and after I took
16:57
Smeirna the Turks hated me like all
16:59
diplomatic relations have ended and the
17:01
Turk is now just out for blood right so
17:03
the Turk has pledged the Turk being a
17:05
dying force has pledged all of its
17:07
support to once again recapturing or
17:11
helping the Austrian in whatever way
17:12
possible and that's just been
17:14
unfortunate for me i see
17:18
but it seems like everything else is
17:20
going good for you at least for now um
17:23
you do need to retreat to Sevastapal but
17:26
other than losing Romania you're
17:27
probably gaining Constantinople and
17:29
maybe Anchora too but right now it's
17:33
counteracted but um who knows the
17:36
Austrian and Turk are now working
17:37
closely they might prevent me from
17:38
getting an next turn which would be a
17:40
shame but it is possible what do you
17:41
think happened to the Austrian Italy i
17:44
can't even read there's so many lines on
17:45
Marseilles and I can't even read that
17:47
honestly yeah so this what Okay
17:49
basically let's see what happened the
17:52
the French uh the French fleet in
17:54
Marseilles moved to the south coast of
17:56
Spain with support from Portugal and
17:58
Gaskini and the army in Spain moved into
18:01
Marseilles with support from Leon and
18:03
Pedmont so they both balanced i see oh
18:05
okay okay i
18:08
mean it was expected because with the
18:11
doubled see it's a shame because I still
18:13
feel like the Austrians could have moved
18:15
against Italy because you know Pedmont
18:17
is busy attacking the French so they
18:20
would have two forces to take Venice but
18:23
it does make tactical like if I was in
18:25
the Austrian position I would also go
18:26
for Germany over Italy just because
18:28
Germany's a dying power italy isn't
18:30
taking German centers is easy taking
18:32
Italian centers will have natural push
18:34
back yes of course okay the But do you
18:39
think that France is in a much better
18:41
position now against the Italians no no
18:43
they really aren't um I wouldn't be
18:46
surprised if next turn England stabbed
18:48
France and just took rest and took um
18:50
Belgium back uh because that is going to
18:54
happen it's inevitable right you you you
18:56
have teased your rear to the English for
18:58
far too long and they will pounce upon
19:00
it um and once that happens France will
19:02
die
19:04
what's funny because like why are you so
19:07
sure that England will stab France and
19:09
not you they will stab me too i mean
19:12
they can stab two at the same time uh
19:14
you see for uh if they were to stab me
19:16
in Norway I mean I can't blame him i did
19:20
the same thing but I also feel like
19:23
because they have so many troops now uh
19:25
it's weird because we have a very
19:27
powerful English rather than a very
19:28
powerful German or France in this game
19:30
um and as a result uh they just have so
19:34
many fleets now controlling the entire
19:36
northern quadrant of the board that they
19:39
can stab both me and the French and get
19:41
away with it at least
19:43
um from a strategic point of view
19:44
because if they were to capt because
19:46
this turn we're going to have builds and
19:47
build dissolution so if they were to
19:49
take Belgium and they were to take
19:50
breast um France will just lose all the
19:54
support it has to keep the Italians away
19:57
all
19:59
right so it seems like here in Ke that
20:04
Berlin moved to Ke well so that was um
20:07
me me and the Austrians still had
20:09
diplomatic i mean the Austrians wanted
20:11
me to cut KE and that Berlin trip wasn't
20:14
doing anything so I did so I didn't know
20:16
the English were going to move into Kio
20:17
but I mean I can't like it makes sense
20:20
so I guess that was necessary that was
20:22
like I told the English that I'm not
20:23
trying to capture K i just want to tap
20:25
Ke to make way for the Austrians that
20:28
was it you seem to think that war with
20:30
the Austrians is inevitable but do you
20:33
think that there's any benefit in
20:34
working together and maybe staying
20:36
friendly for a little while longer and
20:38
growing strong together i would love to
20:41
really I would but I mean the issue is
20:45
the Turk is still on the board and if
20:46
the Turk wasn't on the board we could
20:48
try to work together but the Italian has
20:51
repeatedly or the Austrian has
20:53
repeatedly proven averse to fighting
20:55
other enemies like the Italians and I
20:58
believe that as a result it's far more
21:00
likely that the Austrian will face off
21:03
against me the Russian because my
21:04
centers are far more easier to access as
21:06
compared to the Italian although it is
21:09
possible though now that you mentioned
21:10
it I think that if the Austrian fulfills
21:14
his word which they might not and
21:16
doesn't go for Khan this turn and I
21:18
capture Ankara this turn we could try to
21:20
work together against the Italian and
21:22
against the English but I don't see it
21:24
happening actually because the Austrians
21:26
allied with the English too so there's
21:29
that all right let's move on to the
21:32
current phase that we are currently on
21:35
this is the board state and there are a
21:38
couple questions I want to ask you who
21:40
right now do you think poses the biggest
21:43
threat of winning the game
21:46
the English uh by far the English are
21:49
see as they can kick Norway out there's
21:52
no uh attackers against them in
21:54
Scandinavia and of course France is a
21:57
lame duck right so if they were next
22:00
turn to capture Belgium capture Bruss
22:02
capture Norway that's three builds in
22:04
one turn and all of a sudden they are
22:06
the dominant western power because
22:08
there's no Germany to counteract them
22:09
either and France is crippled from Italy
22:11
so if England plays this right they
22:13
totally could win
22:18
so if you if you were to rank all the
22:20
powers in the game aside from Germany
22:23
and aside from Turkey uh who would be on
22:26
the bottom and who would be second next
22:29
to England i see so I would go England
22:31
at the one at the two I would probably
22:33
go Austria just because Austria has a
22:37
much more solid position than I do i
22:39
have more builds in Austria right now i
22:41
have eight and the Austrian has six I
22:43
believe but they just picked up Munich
22:44
and they just picked Romania and I lost
22:46
one and I got gained Khan so I'm still
22:48
at eight but the Austrian's also at
22:50
eight now right and the Austrian
22:52
position is just so much more tight
22:54
because I am at risk of not gaining
22:57
Ankara next turn and as a result um if I
23:01
like I don't know i feel like my
23:02
position is far more diffused than the
23:04
Austrian one is but that's not to say
23:06
we're far weaker than the Austrians we
23:08
are close behind them and we are
23:09
probably at their level i would just
23:11
rank the Austrians slightly above us
23:13
because they still technically have
23:15
Turkey on their side that treatment is a
23:18
threat to me in Warsaw but it probably
23:20
isn't a threat to the Austrians because
23:22
for some reason Turkey wants to throw a
23:24
game to Austria not to me i wonder why
23:27
it's like I occupied Smyrna or something
23:31
so and you would place yourself at third
23:34
place i'd go third i go Italian at the
23:37
fourth and then the French are the fifth
23:40
i see
23:43
uh do you think that either the there is
23:47
a possibility that France or Italian
23:50
powers could come on top
23:53
italy may be France no France france is
23:56
not happening unfortunately
23:59
italy if England really misplays this
24:02
and if England refuses to go for the
24:04
French centers then yeah it's possible
24:07
uh but it it would require both Austria
24:09
to never attack Italy and England to
24:12
play at a very slow snail-like pace and
24:15
if that happens then yes Italy could
24:18
probably blitz through the French
24:19
defenses and take the majority of those
24:22
centers but it would require a lot of
24:24
luck from both the Austrian and English
24:26
side of things what's the most important
24:28
thing for you to do moving forward
24:31
uh get Ankara and just try to not lose
24:33
any more centers because now it's just a
24:35
game of keeping those centers and slight
24:37
positional play because most diplomatic
24:40
talks will degrade in the coming years
24:43
do you who do you see as your biggest
24:46
allies i know you I know you really like
24:48
France but do you think that you ought
24:52
to be friends with anyone else i would
24:54
hope the Italians because the Italians
24:56
are the only ones who I'm not in direct
24:58
competition with the a so with the
25:00
English and Austrians I am fighting
25:01
obviously for centers with but the
25:03
Italians are far away from me and as a
25:05
result it would be perfect for the
25:07
Italians to move against the Austrians i
25:10
don't see that happening anytime soon
25:12
just because the Italians are busy
25:14
breaking down the French defenses
25:17
but I'm not sure really I'm not
25:20
sure i would say the Italians though all
25:23
right is there anything you would like
25:24
to add or ask me no that's all that's
25:28
all I have all right thank you so much
25:31
uh for this short interview i'm sorry if
25:32
I ate into your time a little bit there
25:34
no totally fine totally fine for sure
25:36
thank you so much and hopefully you'll
25:39
be here next week to also
25:42
