0:00
you guys both ready yes yep okay so this is where we left off last time you guys
0:08
decided in this situation to build a fleet in Liverpool and an army in
0:13
Edenboro so I think the fleet in Liverpool is interesting because it's
0:19
very I I believe it could be easily used against the French players was that it
0:24
the intent for that fleet or what was it really supposed to do
0:30
the fleet in Liverpool you can go ahead
0:36
oh me okay i think that um our main motivation behind building the fleet in
0:41
Liverpool was not necessarily to attack France more at least cuz I think that like France has been like our strongest
0:47
allies since the beginning like after the whole little thing in the beginning when Sean and Lena backstabbed us
0:53
they've been our strongest allies so I think that like that wasn't like our immediate desire it was mostly um
1:00
because that we saw that they were um gaining a lot of fleets or that they were starting to gain fleets in MAO and
1:07
we thought it would be the wisest to sort of secure um that area because
1:12
after France is done with Italy technically the next easiest place for them to go wouldn't be um further
1:20
inland but it would be easiest for them to go north and then go north towards like where we are so we thought that um
1:28
it would be good to just like secure like IRI and like the Irish Sea like is it Irish Sea yes I think so right the
1:34
Irish Sea and then like in that area because as long as we have a fleet there like it would take them another turn for
1:41
them to like sort of get to us and we would have like protection of that sort of area of our territory
1:50
yeah I think so too i mean I think like in the end it's not just protection like
1:57
obviously like at some point we're going to have to attack the French and I think we'll see in later moves that like
2:04
we kind of are moving in on them so uh
2:10
how about the army in Inbra um that was so that we could start
2:15
moving in armies to like the Russian
2:20
territories we were planning on like convoying and then doing some like swapped stuff so that we can get armies
2:26
into like St petersburg and then they can go like down okay we'll see how that turned out um so we're actually coming
2:34
up very si very close and very soon on
2:40
on a move that I absolutely love and it's what happened in Germany but first we have to discuss how you feel about
2:47
the Russians holding all units by missing their order due date how I mean
2:53
like obviously he's benefited from St petersburg do you have any other thoughts on that
3:03
um I mean good for us I guess
3:08
i think that Yeah like I think that like ideally we would have had enough
3:14
like support and enough um like strategic thinking to that even
3:20
if they hadn't submitted their orders we would have been able to like move where we wanted to anyways
3:25
but like it's just like yeah like if they didn't move their fleets cuz they missed the order date like again like
3:31
Jessica said like better for us very well put let's see
3:37
here so at this point I mean I think it's fair to say that France is gaining a lot of ground on Italy and do you
3:44
think that's a good thing right now or a bad thing
3:50
i don't really know what's going on down there like I think we've been kind of uninvolved in that conflict
3:57
because I think Italy wanted our help at first to sort of get at France but then
4:03
we were like nah because like working with France and like at
4:09
times Russia has been beneficial to us in terms of like the Italy like well not sorry not Italy the German
4:16
area so I think that we were able to like establish like stronger ties with
4:22
France than to Italy so really what happens to Italy now is kind of like eh
4:28
like I don't I might I we should probably be more concerned about like how much land they're gaining down there
4:36
but I think we're a little bit more occupied with Austria right now
4:42
yeah I think that like um it could be kind of useful I guess
4:48
for France to be um a little stronger like if we continue
4:54
to be allies because then we they can help us like with Austria but obviously we don't want them to get too strong cuz
5:00
they are right there and they could be a big threat if they do be somehow like make a comeback but like to us it's kind
5:07
of like right now since all of their fleets are diverted at Italy it's kind
5:12
of like we can kind of like move in like whenever we want like there's nothing really stopping us from moving in which
5:18
is another reason why I think that we're not quick to attack them because there's no there's nothing like I think we have
5:24
like more pressing concerns and like if we like they're so worried about us moving into breast but if we wanted to
5:29
move into breast we could just do it at any time like there's no way they can stop us all right that's it oh really i see yeah
5:36
go ahead Ernest funny you might say that because when would be the right time if any to move into depress
5:43
when we're desperate and being attacked and have nowhere else to go i think like when we desperately need
5:51
to start like building stuff if we're like losing a lot of other places and
5:56
like if Austria and Russia become like super super big I think that's when our
6:02
we're kind of going to turn or at least that's when I would um cuz I I haven't
6:07
been like super involved in the game for lost because one I think it started like one
6:13
round when I was retaking a math test okay yeah cuz what happened was I was like studying for like the last little
6:18
bit of my math test in AP Lit cuz why would I listen to Lisa talking when or like do work for AP Lit when I'm I can
6:25
study for my math test right so I stud for my math test and Jessica and Seline appear on the door during third period
6:31
and me and Gabe are like what like what are you guys doing here like like come in right and they're like bored so they
6:36
come in to to AP Lit and then just cuz they're like why are you studying ew
6:42
you're such a nerd stop no one is studying at this point of senior year and then I got a C so I had to go retake
6:50
my math test because I had to keep my grade up so I don't have to take the final so I was like "Okay." So I wasn't
6:57
there that day in Access cuz I had to go retake my math test and ever since then I think I've been kind of like a little
7:02
bit out of the loop especially after today cuz today I wouldn't go do um like a driving practice thing so I get called
7:09
out of school early so like I don't really know what's going on right now but I I'm going to loot myself i have an
7:15
explanation of our moves today we we had I just sent in the ones that like I sent you last week Amber cuz we did the round
7:22
day but I do have an explanation for that for the game makers and some a little
7:27
thing but we'll get there yeah we'll get there when we get there now on to the next move this is my favorite move ever
7:36
in out of this game so far where you guys supported Russia into Austrian controlled Munich with Burgundy also
7:43
supporting South Asia into there so give me your side of the story of that whole
7:48
whole crapshoot that happened right there okay so I think like I don't know
7:54
exactly what happened because I think Jessica did most of the dealing that ended up with Russia in there but the reason like why like we were we pulled
8:02
that move was initially at least I was thinking about supporting Burgundy into Munich
8:10
from supporting Burgundy into Munich but we were saying that like it would probably be better if we had supported
8:17
Russia into Munich because I think the reason we decided like against supporting France
8:23
and there was because of the fact that Austria has two holdings in that area and Russia just simply also has two holdings and it would be easier if we
8:29
both supported Russia in than if we were support we were supposed to like than if
8:35
we were to support Burgundy in because initially what we wanted to do was we wanted heel to support Burgundy in a
8:40
Munich so that Burgundy could support us into um Berlin
8:48
okay the reason why we did this is because well originally I think this was
8:54
the day Amber was retaking a math test so originally Austria comes up to talk
9:00
to us about oh no Russia whatever whatever whatever right and then I'm like okay like if you help us get um
9:08
Berlin Berlin yeah if you help us get Berlin then like I can I can we can
9:14
start moving in on Russia right like we can help you with that you know um but then Gabe and Seline they're like being
9:21
all sneaky or whatever so like I'm trying to deal with them and they're like whispering to each other and then they go to the other side of the room
9:28
and then they're like and then they start talking to the Russians so then I'm like "Okay I'm just gonna drop you cuz you're not going to like they didn't
9:34
like they didn't say like "Oh we'll help you or whatever." Um and then and then later they were like "Oh we're just not
9:40
going to do anything in that area." Right so then I was like "Okay well I'm going to do something about it cuz I
9:47
want something to be done." and they told me they were like moving in more west and I was like "Okay I'm really scared." So then I went to go talk to
9:55
the Russians and the French cuz obviously the French aren't going to want Austria to move west um and then I
10:02
I thought Russia was doing badly that was a lapse in judgment cuz they aren't
10:07
but um so I asked the French I was like "Who are you more scared of Russia or
10:13
Austria?" And they were like "The Austrians." I was like "Okay perfect so let's get the Austrians out of there." And then so I said that um and the
10:20
reason why we wanted the Russians to go in at least like as England we wanted the Russians to go in is because they
10:26
said they would give us Berlin um in return so I was like okay let's cut a
10:31
deal that we all help the Russians into Munich and then the Russians will give
10:36
us Berlin yeah but I didn't see that i didn't know that Russia was going to
10:42
gain another center and that they were just gonna backstab us but it's okay how
10:48
did they backstab you here not this round well it was it was the next round it was next round with Austria but this
10:54
round I remember after I remember after the the results came out for this round oh my god i remember Gabe was being so
11:00
annoying okay bro was lying so annoying because they
11:06
kept being like "Oh like you guys are like you guys like backstab us you guys backstab us like like whatever." They're like "Oh we're so mad we're so mad." And
11:12
like literally every single time like you guys don't understand every single time we play a game with them it's just like this like it's it's like this which
11:17
is why I was so pissed off at them because every single time we play a game and they start losing they really [ __ ] bad sore losers about it okay
11:25
they're really bad sore loser about it so I was like "Okay I mean like technically we did them but at the same
11:32
time why are they mad at us the most like and then they and then they work
11:37
with Russia later and also I didn't even do anything okay I didn't even do anything and they were mad at me and then later on they're like "Oh like
11:43
you're not involved in this." And like why were you mad at me in the first place so then I like I like attacked him which like I feel I feel kind of bad
11:49
about that like sorry I shouldn't have attacked you but also like at the same time like bro like bro because my
11:56
question is that who moved into Munich russia oh do you
12:01
hate us like "Yeah sure we support Russia and Tamunic but then why are you working with them to help them even more when they attack two of your centers?"
12:08
Anyways we'll get there yeah and and they were like And they were like "Wait what what did I say?" They were like "Oh
12:14
like we're not we're not talking to involve you." Like like we're just they're talking about like Jessica but like they already involved me like back
12:20
then so if you're going to involve me then you're going to involve me do you know what I'm saying like don't back out after you already involved me like if
12:26
you're going to bring my name into it already then you can't back out of that like if you're going to bring my name into it I'm in it yeah and this is a
12:33
solely a diplomacy thing yeah of course know her feelings
12:40
so there's something I do want to touch up on jessica you mentioned that you thought the Russians were weak here uh
12:47
why did you think that what led you to believe this i don't remember that was stupid of me oh wait
12:56
no i think we didn't want them to be mad at us because uh we had taken uh St
13:02
petersburg and we kicked out their Finland or at least I was Why do we want
13:07
to be Why didn't we want them to be mad cuz cuz in the previous round we took St
13:13
petersburg and we hadn't talked to them about it so they were already mad and then we were going to kick out Finland
13:19
oh I wasn't worried about that but Oh well I was so and I thought and I I
13:25
thought like at that point um like one of the only ways we could get um the Austrians to stop because I thought the
13:31
Austrians were gaining more and they were and they p more of a threat to most of us and I my thinking was like oh if
13:40
as long as we can stop them but then I guess I just I wasn't using my brain with Russia
13:48
why is it that you guys in this fall chose to hold four of your fleets
13:55
where would they go cuz like technically like we could have moved those two fleets but we promised France that we
14:00
wouldn't move it on them so we we weren't cuz like cuz like people people will say that like again like as we've
14:06
established in past interviews people be like "Oh like you backstabbed us." Like no we didn't if we're unclear about like if we don't say yes to your deal if
14:12
we'll say like "Oh like we'll think about it." If we're unclear about like whether or not we'll actually like like go through with it then we're probably
14:17
not going to do it like we're very clear when when it is like something that we want to do you know like we're very
14:23
clear when we say yes to something yeah my thing is that we always say like if someone's like "Oh will you do this?"
14:29
And we're always going to be like "Yes yes we're going to do it." Like if we actually do it like we're going to say yes and then we'll be like sketchy about
14:35
it if like we're not going to do it you know we're sketchy about we're like "Oh like that's like that's an interesting deal like we'll think about it." But we
14:40
don't we don't take it so like if you if you think that we backstabbed you you're just not smart about it i think we're
14:45
pretty like if you like see our patterns we're pretty obvious about it some other people are not and they're lying
14:54
backstabbers and they say "Oh we'll give you a chance to show that we can trust you oh we trust you guys we'll do this."
15:02
Really okay anyways next play
15:12
wait what is this canon you're muted my bad so you decide to build an army in
15:19
London right and I assume this is basically the same philosophy as before you want armies on the mainland
15:27
yeah yeah pretty much well so then what are your thoughts on
15:34
the Russians being able to build two armies here making it more congested
15:41
a little scary cuz I think Oh wait i can I need to look at the map a little bit more
15:48
i don't yeah I think I was like I knew they were have one from Munich but then
15:55
I like I didn't realize like the disbanding thing i thought it just like kills
16:02
the the army or whatever so I didn't realize they would or they got what did they get rum they
16:09
got ramen and got and they didn't they lost St petersburg because they lost St
16:16
petersburg and they gained two they should have only had one build but because they disbanded Finland they got
16:22
another yeah I think that's the thing like um they disbanded so I didn't know that
16:30
they had two builds and that's a little scary well I mean it wasn't much of a choice no I know it's I know it's not
16:37
but like I think I just like underestimate the Russians sometimes i think like we'll
16:45
deal with it like I think it's just like like they get more armies like we'll build we'll find a way to like work around it
16:51
all right like I think I think it'll be fun i don't really like it moving on to the next phase of the game here
16:59
um so a lot of interesting things are happening here the English channel is moving into Belgium you are getting
17:06
Berlin with Russian consent as they are moving out um so why don't we explain those why are
17:13
you going into Belgium when France was your ally that was part of a deal that we had with
17:19
them like they they wanted us in Belgium for some reason i don't remember oh they wanted us to get out of the English
17:26
Channel and we were like "So where are we supposed to go belgium." And they and they were like
17:32
"Oh you guys are going to like move into Belgium if like you give it back later." We never said if you give it back this
17:37
time but then after we took it they were like "Oh you guys are giving back Belgium as a promise." Like that was our
17:42
promise right and I was like "No it's not but whatever we'll give it back I guess." Like
17:48
I don't know i I don't know what happened this round cuz I wasn't like there and as for Berlin this was also part of
17:56
a deal made last phase where you This was part of the deal with Munich yeah the Munich deal
18:05
so what are what are your thoughts on Russia attacking Austria right here
18:12
i just think it's like weird that they would like work together after that but like I I think it's
18:19
like I don't really like
18:24
Yeah I don't really feel strongly about it i don't I don't really care if they attack each other the other So go ahead
18:31
go ahead Jessica sorry no sorry it's just like I don't really As long as they're focused on each other and like
18:37
they kind of I guess I don't I think we should be wary if like one starts to gain way more over the other but other
18:44
than that like if they're fighting down there it's okay with us the other interesting thing
18:52
that could probably affect you is this rogue Austrian army over here in Rur mhm
18:58
i'm guessing this is not something you really like you do not want the Austrians in that territory we do not
19:04
want that no
19:10
okay i think this is a relatively simple phase so let's move on to the next one yeah oh this one a lot of things
19:18
happened here um first you lose Keel and you lose Berlin
19:25
what are your thoughts on that that made me mad because it's like why
19:30
are the Austrians working with the Russians like when I I get why they're
19:36
mad at us but also the Russians are the one who moved into M and they're the ones who are taking all their other
19:42
territories like on the Eastern Front area so like I don't really understand
19:48
why they would work together and also because during negotiations I think Amber were you here that day i
19:55
don't remember if you were here but I don't know either i don't think you were there because I was I remember like I
20:01
was talking to like Gabe and Seline and then I was like I was telling them I would help them in back into month and I
20:07
was like let let us show you that you can trust us you know like we'll I don't
20:12
think I was there for I don't know what I was doing i was I don't think you were there so then I was like you know you
20:18
guys can trust us will help you there because obviously we know that you guys have a lot going on with the Russians
20:24
down in the eastern like southeastern area um and then and then they were like
20:30
all secretive or whatever and then after like 10 minutes um Gabe and Seline they're like they're like "Okay okay
20:36
we've decided to trust you guys this time we're going to trust you we're going to go through with the deal." And I was like "Cool." Like that's great and
20:43
then and then this comes up and they don't just take Munich they also take well the Russians take Berlin because
20:50
they like talked about what we were doing with them and then we also agreed to help our buddies out in France even
20:57
though we never actually promised them Belgium back but we gave it back to them because we were being nice people and
21:03
then so we basically lost everything that we gained i kind of don't really know what happened this round but I'm
21:08
just going to go based off of Jessica i don't I wasn't necessarily like upset about like the the what do you what do
21:16
you call the Austrian and Russian play i think it was smart on their part but I just think it was
21:22
like that was backstabbing though that is a definition of backstabbing when you tell someone okay we're going to trust
21:29
you like like they are saying that they can't trust us yet they're they're being
21:35
like and we're trying to offer up like good faith you know we're trying to act in good faith and be all like nice to
21:40
them and then and they say they're going to go through with the deal and then they turn on you like that's what
21:46
backstabbing is i think it was a bit of an obnoxious move but I was like I don't know why do you think that the Austrians
21:53
would go through with this rather than defending Russia cuz they think they're
21:58
funny like Gab's a troll and Seline is like she like like I'm not speaking to
22:04
their character like I think like it's funny most of the time but I'm just saying that like I think that like they did it because they think it's funny
22:09
like like that's just who they are well in and if I were them I think it's
22:14
funny like I'm not blaming them i mean like in the game I think it's because they like the the last move when
22:22
we helped Russia and Munich like they were mad at us they were not mad at or they were mad at me whatever um they
22:29
were mad at me like they were not mad at Russia at all they like I remember they literally turned to Russia and they were
22:35
like "We're not mad at you this is not your fault." And then they turned to us and they were like "Why would you do that?" So this was their payback
22:42
okay so well what are do you think
22:48
you're the type of player to hold grudges against another nation
22:53
we haven't really that's that's an interesting thought well I don't I don't think so cuz I think it's like like to me like
23:01
I don't think it matters that much yeah i mean if they're going to help us like in the future we'd probably work
23:07
with them well it just we haven't really worked with them at all in an instance where
23:13
like we helped each other out or we could trust each other so
23:18
it's funny because I think the ability to forgive is a very crucial part of
23:25
diplomacy and you have done that with France at the very beginning um do you
23:31
think that such an ability to diplomatically solve things maybe like
23:36
how Austrian Russia did right here can lead to better rewards in the future
23:44
i mean like yeah but they literally just helped Russia get two more centers they didn't really do anything for themselves
23:49
though i don't see how that was really a reward for them yeah I think that
23:55
they're I think that they're shooting themselves in the foot like ultimately
24:02
okay um let's move on to the next phase where unfortunately you don't get any
24:08
builds and the French build a fleet in breast now what are your thoughts on
24:14
that they told us they were going to do that
24:19
and like what are they they they're not going to attack they can't really attack us so we're okay
24:26
okay it's This is just one more fleet that's not under your control i thought you would have more aggressive They they
24:33
they said they would they're doing it for Italy or whatever and like I don't know at this point like we could take it
24:40
out if we wanted if it like moves into MAO or tries to attack English like we could just support each other like our
24:47
fleets i don't know exactly what moves we made this round cuz I kind of forgot well cuz I think me and Jessica talked
24:52
about before but I think we didn't get to make anything no any like moves like like this like round that we just did oh
24:59
so but I think that whatever I think whatever happened I don't think the French are very happy with it i think we might I have an explanation for that
25:05
though okay if they don't listen I think we might just like if they don't believe us I think we might just take them out here comes Here comes the bomb I guess
25:12
you could say cuz this move is insane i love this move especially when you're
25:17
looking at France and Italy alone like they're kind of not fighting
25:23
anymore so I don't know what's happening there but also you're forcefully moving yourself into MAO so yes please explain
25:31
what's up with that well I think Amar and I talked about this last week and we
25:37
were like I think it's time to start moving on France right but did we say that yeah like last Friday or Thursday
25:45
or whenever um I don't know bro but I don't remember that but okay okay well
25:51
that's what happened um okay but then France let me let me read the
25:57
thing wait France oh we're starting a drama as
26:03
McBride would say are we allowed to reg yeah you can to me but not to other people you can at 5:08 p.m today sean
26:11
asks "Wait why are we being attacked i just opened the board." And then so I said "Sorry we didn't mean to attack you
26:17
we aren't trying to invade we just wanted to move there to help you with Italy sorry we didn't get a really we didn't really get a chance to talk about
26:23
it cuz now we can help you with WES the West or something
26:29
West whatever um because like technically that's true like we could help them with that um because they if
26:37
they want to attack Italy they kind of need our help there um and then
26:42
also because like we actually didn't get a chance to talk like Sean didn't talk
26:48
to me at all like recently Audrey and Shawn have been standing outside either
26:54
orchestra or in the in the breakfast line and bombarding me with questions in
26:59
the morning and they go and they stand there and they're like "So what are your
27:04
plans?" And we but like this time we didn't really get to talk about that um
27:10
so wait but then he he just sent me something let me read this because I haven't read it yet uh he said "You didn't have to force your way in by
27:17
supporting your movie with England we told you before that MAO was off limits." Oh wait okay so they're mad um
27:29
damn no but like literally we'll just help them i think we can just get their trust by helping them with
27:35
WES you know i think we'll just like wait it out in MAO and then we can help them with Wes and like it'll be fine are
27:42
you at all worried about what they chose to do with their units hold what did they do i mean like they
27:50
were trying to go in MAO and he just said MAO is off limits well you're trying to go in there so yeah no he
27:56
meant MA was off limits to us which I don't know like why they want to get in MA so badly like there's nothing over there except for us
28:04
yeah i think they might be trying to like protect Breast because I think they think that we're going to try to move in
28:12
well I think the fact that we didn't even attack that like and I think next time if we help them with Italy and we
28:17
don't attack Portugal says a lot you know or if we don't attack breast or
28:22
something like I feel like it says a lot that we're not doing that okay they can't make any moves against
28:29
us are you worried that you've made an enemy right now cuz it doesn't seem like
28:35
they're too happy well I mean I think we can just explain ourselves cuz he said "Okay wait let me read what he said." Um
28:42
he he said um um okay so basically he's like "You
28:48
guys didn't tell us beforehand." And he said "If you guys aren't helping like you say you are like what I sent in the
28:53
text and you're trying to move in on Portugal or worse you're allied with Italians to get them into Spain or something we'll have contingencies set
29:00
up if MAO fleet doesn't retreat to IRI or move to NAF next turn." But like I
29:07
mean like I said we're literally we'll literally just help them like I think he
29:12
says they'll wait it out one turn and then they'll attack us if we're not helping them
29:18
i think they But how do they know if we're helping them or not they just have to trust us i mean they
29:23
can't do anything right now yeah they can't do anything about it i think I I think they think they don't need our allyship in Mayo cuz they have a fleet
29:30
now so they think that they're like powerful in their area
29:36
yeah i mean I think we'll just respond and you might want to respond right now cuz
29:41
he sees that you read the message and you don't respond like he's going to be like "Please why don't you respond to the message
29:47
mhm i know what do you think's going on in Germany right now Amber please please in Germany yes
29:55
um well I wasn't there so
30:02
um I'm not sure i mean I think that we're trying to move back into KE
30:08
there's always a chance that like Austria and Russia will like work
30:14
together again so what are the chances do you think that France would help
30:19
Russia in this Germany area maybe do something with Holland or have Russia help him into there now that you have
30:26
almost aggressively asserted your dominance by moving into
30:31
MAO well that's an interesting way to put it Kenan i think well I think like France and
30:41
um which France and Russia have been working with each
30:48
other like a lot so I don't think that like the chances are not high but it's
30:55
not like we don't have support in that area like our North Sea fleet is there for a reason cuz we have a little holdings there in that area like our
31:00
North Sea fleet could hopefully help hold the
31:06
area cuz like what are they I think they would just bounce like what are they going to do they don't have more support in that
31:14
area okay um let's see do you have any other questions Ernest uh not at the moment no
31:26
so moving on moving forward what is the most important thing for you guys to do
31:38
i don't know cuz I think that like I've always been like heavily against attacking
31:43
France but if they really think that we're going to attack them anyways and we lost so many centers to
31:51
Austria and Russia within the past two rounds we might we might just need to
31:56
like move in what are your thoughts Jessica
32:04
um wait she's busy diplomacy also because I don't I don't like their naval
32:09
presence in breast you said say that again Amber i don't like their naval presence and breast
32:15
that much well I mean if you're allowed to defend yourself in Liverpool why can't they defend themselves in breast
32:22
they're allowed to i just They don't like they don't like they didn't like that we had a ship near Liverpool and they're allowed to feel
32:29
that way just like we're allowed to defend ourselves i think that they can feel whatever way they want to about our
32:37
fleet and I think I think that like we don't we don't have to like it and breast but we can we can like tolerate
32:42
it it depends on whether or not they believe that we're willing to help them out if they don't believe that we're willing to help them out then we might
32:48
as well like take them out in this area while they're still weak or
32:58
wait sorry what was the question uh so Jessica the question was "What do you
33:04
think is the most important thing for you to do moving forward?" Now
33:10
I think like the Kio area is not very nice right now cuz like Russia and Austria like are
33:19
they still working together are they not working together i think we have to be careful of France too in um Belgium like
33:27
cuz like if we make them mad somewhere in the west then they're they can work with Austria easily although like I
33:33
don't know why anyone will work with them right now um I think we're on playing defense for
33:41
now so were when so when you were distracted earlier was that diplomacy
33:46
related or something else yes i was sending Sean back do you want me to read the messages sure sure okay so basically
33:53
he was like why didn't you guys tell us everything is off limits whatever I read you earlier so I just told him like
33:59
"Sorry for not telling you beforehand can we show you guys you can trust us in the next term we really just want to help you guys with Italians because it
34:05
seems like it was kind of a standstill in that area um we're planning on talking to you guys about We were planning on talking to you guys about
34:12
helping you into West like for the next turn but if you don't want our help there we can also go somewhere else also
34:20
one more thing as for not telling you guys we didn't talk to any countries this round other than the Friday morning I saw you guys it was sincerely a lack
34:26
of time to talk to people about strategy not us trying to be sneaky although like
34:31
was kind of us trying to be sneaky but wait I haven't do anything right away i
34:37
don't know what's going on so I'm just going to like This is one of our first interviews i
34:43
think this is our first interview post prom well not our first this is our second this is our second postp prom
34:49
interview did you guys negotiate at all i didn't ask this question uh with the
34:54
Russian interview but did you negotiate at all during prom or ball well Jessica was an appball but I didn't I just
35:01
didn't think it was I just didn't think it was like time place and manner
35:07
yeah because I was like if if I have ball like I don't really talk about diplomacy especially because I don't really I don't really know what's going on these past few rounds it's very
35:13
natural who do you think poses the biggest threat to win this game
35:21
oo Russia or Austria i don't know no
35:28
Russia yeah Russia because they've got Austria completely surrounded
35:34
i think Austria stabbed themselves in the foot by allying with um Russia in the past couple rounds i don't think
35:39
they should have done that for like their own purposes like there was really no reason for them to do that
35:46
so what do you think is the most important conversation for you to have with the other country aside from the
35:53
French
35:58
um I don't really know we've kind of isolated ourselves I guess but like the thing about like Austria is like I'm
36:05
confused because they're always like "When are you guys planning on attacking the French when are you guys planning on attacking the Russians?" And then they
36:10
go to the French and and we're always like "Oh we're not going to do it yet we're going to wait a bit." And then they go to the French and the Russians
36:16
and they're like "Oh my goodness England said that they're going to they're waiting on attacking you guys they're
36:21
planning on backstabbing." Which we're not that's literally backstabbing them anytime soon
36:28
like yes if it comes to that that's just the nature of the game obviously we're going to have to backstab them at some point like so Austria keeps wanting us
36:36
to do their dirty work attack the Russians from the north attack the French just get the French out of the game like maybe you guys should protect
36:42
yourselves cuz Russia Russia's doing a lot down there yeah Russia's doing a lot
36:49
so do you think that you should be equally as active trying to convince everybody to further your own agenda
37:00
this game has to taken a toll on my life cuz I think that
37:06
like like from the like I don't know like from the
37:17
beginning from like like we've always established from the beginning if we say yes to your deal we're taking it if we
37:25
don't say yes and we're ambiguous about it we're probably not going to take it or we're still thinking about it but we're we're we have no guarantee that
37:31
we're going to take it and if you're playing this game you should know that and I think that the way that Austria has been playing this game is I think
37:37
that like Jessica saying like they they're like "Oh like this is what they're like oh like uh England this is what happens when you guys make no like
37:43
allies." But it's not that we don't make allies it's that they're actively lying to other countries about what it is that we're doing so in that case it's not us
37:52
not making allies i think it's them messing with our reputation when in reality I don't think
37:59
that we we don't we don't really do anything that's not like I wouldn't say that it is above
38:05
board but like we show you the board it's not like it's not like we're like like hiding it completely do you know
38:11
what I'm saying like we have a pattern and we're pretty upfront or like about like if we again like if we say yes it's
38:18
a yes if we don't say yes then you can't even guarantee that in the first place that we're going to go through what we're doing
38:23
but I think I think that like in terms of you saying like should we be talking to other countries more i think we can
38:30
but that's not up to us if they like really believe us or not but like we can
38:36
try do you know what I'm saying so and there's and there's this there's
38:42
thing where like Gabriel thinks that he's so blameless gabriel thinks that he's so blameless there's this thing that he does like even back in testimony
38:49
that really annoyed me where Justin also confirmed this but he he does this thing where like when he's being annoying his lips move a certain way like he talks a
38:55
certain way and it makes me so mad and he doesn't even know he's doing it so sometimes he's like I didn't do anything
39:00
i didn't do anything but like you know that like subconsciously when he's trying to be annoying like that's what he does like his his mouth starts moving
39:06
a certain way and it it like makes me want to like like choke him out like that makes me so mad
39:13
so yeah he was like "Oh England like like you
39:20
guys like this you guys don't make any allies like or talking to other
39:25
countries like what long-term allies do you have?" You you say "Oh um they they
39:32
were going around saying like um England literally said that they don't make long-term allies." Well yeah but no one
39:38
does you don't even have any allies like at least we're allies with France and
39:44
they will know that game per like round per round like yeah and again we've been
39:49
above board about that we're not like oh like we we're going to protect you guys indefinitely we we always say like hey
39:54
we'll like go this round we'll go this round if people interpret that differently that's not that's not our fault we've always been we've always say
40:00
that we make allies round to round if that allyship happens to extend past multiple rounds that's just because
40:06
we're both mutually beneficial for each other in those rounds so like we have been with France but
40:13
like there's no like there's no guarantee like you have to like reestablish your dealings with us every single time because what else would it
40:18
be why would we assume that our deals from the past still like hold do you know what I'm saying why would we assume
40:25
that when it's a completely different round with completely different circumstances understood so you guys mentioned that
40:32
you think Russia is the biggest threat to win this game what can you do diplomatically and strategically to help
40:40
solve this issue
40:48
i don't know i'm like tired can the war be over can we all
40:54
just Wait is this game ending like at the end of the school year no well if there is a will to continue it
41:01
afterwards then cuz like I'm not going to be in the country and then I think
41:06
when I'm back Amber is not going to be in the country yeah so
41:11
basically basically if we back out of the game we leave our land to France and
41:16
our and our English will That's not quite how it works we We
41:22
could put the game We could have options we could put the game on pause or you
41:27
can continue trying to communicate digitally although that might be a bit difficult
41:34
or wait doesn't didn't this game like end when somebody got like eight centers 18
41:39
cent 18 bro bro
41:47
we're going to be doing this into like like sophomore year of college guys like I think we should go by the history you
41:54
know history tends to repeat itself and what does history say oh England won oh
42:00
guys I think England won england is nothing if not we don't have
42:06
to go through this all again we just have to look at history okay the So so there's a couple of
42:13
options you can either try to continue it via digital we can end it we can
42:18
pause it or we can sub you in like replace you with another player if
42:24
that's fine but we'll come down to that when we come down to it i personally want to see a very satisfying conclusion
42:31
to this game if as in England winning I mean sure that could be your satis I
42:36
could I'm down for anyone to win honestly if Italy wins that's cool if France win that's cool austria win cool
42:42
russian win cool because like the sad thing about game mastering is you get
42:47
you start rooting for everybody and at that point oh no no not everyone can win
42:52
only one shall remain i'm not super like I'm not super like oh
42:58
like we have to win like I feel like you would feel that with like my personality
43:03
like I feel like people would assume that like I'd be very competitive at board games but I'm not like Jessica's known me forever i don't really care
43:09
like it's it's fun what we were playing Risk at Sol i just
43:16
got bored like I was like this game like I got bored i got bored it wasn't even because like
43:22
I don't know like the most fun that I had while playing Risk was like the fact that like I think I got Algeria by like by like roll I had my I forgot why but I
43:29
had my Alless Tokilo keychain and I rolled a dice with my with my keychain and I got Algeria and that was like the
43:35
most fun I had in that game i don't really I'm not very competitive about board games and it annoys me when people
43:41
are cuz it actually it like makes me mad when people are cuz I don't understand like why you're getting so pressed over
43:46
it and I know that's a lot coming from me cuz I get pressed over everything but I feel like board games is like the one thing that you should not be getting
43:52
pressed about i don't know i disagree but okay yeah jessica Jessica's like Jessica gets
43:58
Jessica gets very mad over board games um I don't do that okay so honestly I
44:05
get where you're coming from i I'm one of those people that fall into that too competitive camp but hey it's okay you
44:12
can get pressed about me later if we ever play a board game together the other the other thing I think this might
44:17
be one of the last questions but if Russia is a big threat and they somehow manage to get close to 18 centers let's
44:25
say they have 17 centers do you think that at that point
44:31
you would be able to set aside your differences with Austria or any other power and maybe check Russia or would
44:41
you be too tired would you not want to continue the fight and just let Russia
44:46
win i mean we'll pair up with Austria when whenever Austria wants to pair up with
44:53
us if it's in this next game and they come begging to us and they're going to help us like okay uh I don't like I know
45:02
what I said earlier but at the same time like there is still that thing of like we we just do our allyships game by
45:09
game so if you box that bus before we're willing to like you know work with you
45:15
again if it's going to help us so and also I feel like I don't know i feel
45:20
like like as much as I'm like "Oh like Gabe is so annoying like like I love Gabe and Seline." Like I'm not going to
45:26
like you know what I'm saying like if they if they come and they're like "Oh we want to ally with you guys." I'm not going to be like "No." Do you know what I'm saying like we'll hear them out like
45:31
if it if it works like it works you know it's like the name of the game we're all just playing a game so it's like that's
45:38
why I'm like why are people getting so pressed about this like do you have nothing better to do with your life but anyways oh damn
45:46
that's what I'm saying cuz like that's the thing though like I know that like everybody here has like a better thing to worry about so why don't you worry
45:52
about that instead of being like "Oh like you you backstabbed me in diplomacy when I when we didn't even It's just
45:58
fun." Like it's part of the fun it's like getting super invested into like
46:03
Legend of Zelda or something like do you have nothing better to do with your life no that's like different though cuz like
46:09
why are you trying to like get mad at me for something that like we're like playing a game over you know it's part of the game i don't know maybe it's part
46:17
of it but I don't know i think I think I'm a little bit like Graham and I take things a little bit personally a little
46:23
bit personally sometimes remind me never to show this part of the interview to Mr mcbride gra no you can show him it'd be
46:30
fine i don't care i'll say him also another thing another thing about me is I say something about you to
46:36
somebody else I'll say it to your face it just depends on like if you ask me or not or if it comes up
46:43
like if I completely hate your guts if you ask me about it I will say like "Yes I don't like you." Wow the Okay so let's move on ernest do
46:52
you have any other questions for our friends here um not at this moment
46:58
okay do you guys have any questions for us um maybe
47:06
like actually I feel like most of the questions like I'd be curious about hearing from you probably probably can't answer wait let me let me ask though do
47:13
you have like a do you have like a favorite like play like in terms of the game yeah so
47:22
yeah yeah yeah yeah there's a lot of interesting things that you can do in a board like this in fact oh man I'm so
47:31
Okay I guess I'll share you some since you asked just a little bit of
47:37
strategic actually you know what no I'll do a fun example you can have a paradox in this
47:42
game like a paradox such that you know like this this statement is false but
47:48
because it's false it must be true and because it's true it has to be false like that kind of paradox here uh let me
47:55
Bro thinks he's Bro and CR and Gil start like I actually don't know what you're talking about okay well sorry i'll I'll
48:02
let me see if I can pull it up i'm gonna I'm gonna pull it up real quick and let's see here
48:10
um yeah this was this was in the planned uh strategic uh diplo advanced tactics
48:17
kind of thing but nobody wanted to not everybody wanted to see it because everybody wanted to gatekeep their own
48:22
strategies but near the end I was like "Okay let's just let's just check this let's just
48:28
check this out using this example." So
48:33
the interesting thing here is I mean you guys haven't had an encounter with this rule but if a if a fleet that's
48:39
convoying is forced to retreat then the convoy fails so just keep that important rule
48:46
in mind when this army in Inbor is convoy to Denmark the Denmark support to
48:52
have North Sea hold fails right which means that this English Channel fleet is
48:58
able to successfully dislodge North Sea and because it successfully dislodges North Sea Edenboro can't make it to
49:05
Denmark and because Denmark support holds North Sea and because Edinburgh can't make it to Denmark it successfully
49:11
holds which means that this English Channel fleet will s unsuccessfully dislodge it which means this inbro fleet
49:18
will successfully cut support and you just go around in a circle like there is
49:23
no there is no practically solvable solution for this set of moves
49:30
but but basically because this was found out a new rule was written where if this
49:36
scenario of moves happens everything holds resolving the paradox it's it's it's just I just love it it's so fun
49:43
the But if that's not exactly what you were looking for there's a couple other cool things like here let's see can I
49:52
Okay yeah yeah yeah this is a cool scenario here as well let's say that
49:59
you're Russia you have an allied fleet a German fleet in the Ionian Sea and you
50:05
have this Italian fleet in TYS you see in this situation it's a 50-50
50:11
guess because you want to get one of these centers and the Italian can cover either to make it a 100% guess you can
50:18
just force this fleet to retreat after the Italian move which means that
50:24
whichever one is open you can choose to go too that's smart i don't think I'm smart
50:30
enough for this game like I don't I don't know what's going on but I'll trust you that that's really smart well I mean either well in this scenario e
50:38
even if you bounce you still can retreat to a province of your choice if you
50:43
bounce in Naples or Tunisia yeah because it is it gets it gets complicated it and I get I mean Okay
50:52
hold on do you think it's fair Ernest I'll have you I'll have you call this one do you think it's fair if I show him
50:58
the rest of this or should I not should I restrain myself wait I have other things I need to do tonight i mean you
51:05
just show it to them later i guess I can um here let me stop sharing my screen
51:11
see you could also show me but I don't think I would understand anyways so well it's not that it's unfair because people
51:17
can do their own research and we're not providing extra game information we're
51:22
providing Yeah we're just we're just Yeah do you have any other questions for us
51:29
thank you so much for taking the time to come here um I I'm very glad that you guys are
51:35
still willing to play this game so thank you yeah it's Thank you Ken thank you
51:43
guys bye bye game master see you guys next time actually see you guys tomorrow bye that's true but
