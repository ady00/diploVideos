0:00
but oh she's right there Hello It took a
0:02
second to connect Okay so we're kind of
0:06
kind of cut um very very pressed for
0:09
time This is where we left off last time
0:12
And it was this phase that you guys
0:15
pretty much decided to move against
0:17
France Am I wrong moving into
0:19
mid-Atlantic Ocean here forcefully Um
0:23
can you give me your reasons behind
0:25
doing that
0:32
what was the I for I forgot what was
0:35
going on during that round I just feel
0:36
like at that point like there's it's
0:40
kind of go against them or do nothing
0:42
because they're not helping us much and
0:43
they keep just wanting Belgium back and
0:46
then like they're of no use essentially
0:50
Yeah
0:52
Well we'll see if we'll see if that
0:54
decision backfires in any
0:56
[Music]
0:57
way Um I do I do what I'm more I'm more
1:03
concerned about how you feel at the end
1:07
especially because I would characterize
1:10
these rounds more on like the movements
1:14
themselves rather than the like
1:16
alliances between people
1:19
It's uh I would you say that do you feel
1:21
like there's a shift between like really
1:24
negotiating with people and just like
1:26
attacking and attacking and attacking
1:30
i think there just wasn't a lot of place
1:31
for everybody to go So I think that
1:33
there wasn't really anything we could
1:34
all do except for attack each other Yeah
1:36
I think it was also hard to have
1:38
alliances like when you weren't like
1:40
seeing people at school Like yesterday
1:42
though during fourth period I had a
1:44
two-hour conversation with Russia to try
1:46
and get them to go with our deal and
1:48
like
1:50
so I like there there was still some
1:53
alliance stuff but it was mainly just
1:55
like on our own like fending for
1:57
ourselves Well how about how about you
2:00
outline this deal of yours with Russia
2:02
what was the what was the idea oh no
2:03
with Austria sorry What was the idea
2:06
with Austria um it's kind of later in
2:09
the Do we want to go wait was this in
2:11
fourth period yeah it was yesterday Okay
2:14
Yeah So during fourth period while
2:15
Jessica was outlining this alliance I
2:16
had figured out that I had forgot to do
2:19
like three of the assignments Well it
2:21
was categorized as one assignment It was
2:22
actually three separate assignments for
2:24
math that I thought were optional So my
2:25
grade dropped like 5% So I was panicking
2:28
trying to finish them And then I was
2:29
like Jessica like I can't like you're
2:30
just going to have to like I see bug it
2:32
out with Austria
2:34
Oh well it happens to the best of us Uh
2:38
so here you decide to take breast I I
2:42
actually remember this I asked you like
2:43
if you're actually going to take breast
2:45
in the moment and you're like "Well I
2:47
don't I don't think so." Okay I have
2:49
something to say about that So basically
2:51
we were on call last time when France
2:53
got all mad at us for moving into MAO
2:55
right but then I was trying to talk them
2:57
out of it I was trying to be like "We
2:58
can help you with Italy." And I sent
2:59
this whole them this whole explanation
3:01
and then they never responded to me
3:03
which I feel like first of all that's
3:05
kind of rude Like I'm trying to like
3:07
compromise I'm trying to like make you
3:08
guys feel better and I'm trying to help
3:10
you guys and you're not going to respond
3:12
So clearly if you're not going to
3:14
respond I think you're trying to plot
3:16
something against us So then I was like
3:18
well if they don't want to work with us
3:20
then like and I I told them like let us
3:23
know if like I was like we can show you
3:26
guys that you can trust us and we can
3:28
help you go against Italy And then they
3:30
were like they just like never responded
3:32
So I was like well if you're not going
3:33
to respond we're going to attack you So
3:36
I think there there was a reason why we
3:37
were in MAO like the round before there
3:39
was a reason why I don't remember why it
3:41
was because we were going to have Italy
3:43
and that's what I sent them and they
3:44
just but there was a separate reason why
3:46
we were in MAO I think it was one Italy
3:49
and then also because of their naval
3:51
force and breast like why do you need a
3:53
naval force and breast like what is that
3:54
for so we were I think we moved there as
3:58
a way to protect our own territories and
3:59
they got defensive about us We were like
4:01
if you really think we're going to
4:02
attack you we might as well do it
4:05
I see Well let's
4:08
see around this time Um I'm guessing you
4:12
start talking to Austria right yes
4:16
Because I mean right now in this in this
4:20
stage of the game you actually have 10
4:21
centers and Russia has nine But in order
4:24
to eliminate the Russian threat you do
4:26
need Austrian help What were
4:27
negotiations like around here with
4:30
Austria
4:33
oh this is when Austria backstabbed us
4:36
Didn't we already talk about this we
4:37
already talked about that Uh this is
4:40
this is different Um
4:42
I believe I'm not quite too sure what
4:45
exactly is happening here
4:48
I don't know what's happening there
4:49
either
4:51
Wait I for I don't know I think that I
4:55
don't know Austria
4:59
I don't think we were talking to Austria
5:01
yet I see Well I don't think we were So
5:04
I think I think yeah diplomatically like
5:08
alliances were pretty stagnant at this
5:10
point like No no I remember what was
5:12
happening I remember what's happening
5:13
here Austria wanted us to move out of
5:17
Holland to move into RU to kick Russia
5:19
out
5:22
And you didn't want to do that why we
5:24
didn't want to do that because Austria
5:25
kept on expecting us or France to make a
5:27
move on RU But they were like even
5:30
though like they were like "Oh yeah like
5:32
you guys should just move in Oh France
5:34
you guys should just move in." And we
5:35
were like "Why don't you guys why are
5:37
you guys so willing to sacrifice our
5:38
territories our holdings when it's your
5:41
plan like if it's your plan then you
5:42
guys should be the one to move into
5:44
RU you know?" Mhm So we were like "Why
5:47
do you want us out of that area so bad
5:49
we're not doing it." And that was really
5:51
stupid of them not to like support
5:54
Munich Like I don't know what they were
5:57
doing They could have they didn't do
5:58
anything They weren't even doing with
6:00
anything with BO Like I don't know what
6:02
they were thinking Yeah
6:05
Sorry Real real real quick One one thing
6:09
What's going on oh okay But while the
6:11
video while the video is still going cuz
6:13
we were cuz they they got me like "Oh
6:15
like Yeah You guys should just kick out
6:16
like Rush out of R." We were like "Why
6:18
do we have to do the leg work like if
6:19
it's your plan we have as much brisk in
6:21
it as you You guys should just use Muta
6:22
to kick them out."
6:25
Yeah And we're surrounded by like
6:27
Holland and K They can just move be
6:29
whatever into Munich I don't know
6:34
So moving on to the next phase This
6:39
was Oh wait I think I remember this This
6:42
one is
6:46
Oh my
6:47
god This was my big flop Okay we got
6:52
massacred this round cuz I messed up Um
6:57
we messed up on one of the or we you
7:00
wrote it down I didn't catch it Oh so we
7:02
the other Sorry
7:07
Okay
7:12
All right I'm back Sorry Uh I I have
7:16
graduation too I need to figure it out
7:17
please Okay Yeah No it's okay What are
7:19
the big flaws that you made here okay
7:21
First of all Sweden the fleet in Sweden
7:23
was supposed to move to SKA instead of
7:26
Denmark which by that moving to Denmark
7:30
screwed up my entire plan of how we were
7:32
going to take out Russia because then
7:34
Eden Burrow could not move to Denmark
7:37
and then could not move to whatever LVN
7:39
is and then we could not attack Moscow
7:42
you know Mhm So then cuz Russia right
7:45
now there is pretty defenseless and it
7:47
in like a few moves we could have taken
7:49
over Moscow but no because I screwed up
7:52
and I moved Sweden to Denmark for some
7:54
reason I don't even know why I did like
7:57
I don't know how that I think I was like
7:59
writing it really last minute and then I
8:01
meant to say SK but then I just saw
8:02
Denmark and then I was like Denmark but
8:05
I didn't catch it though cuz I don't
8:06
think I knew what Jessica was doing so I
8:08
don't think I caught what was happening
8:10
And then I was I I didn't realize that
8:13
like um you you see how like Belgium is
8:16
still France's territory but we're in it
8:19
I didn't realize that like um you have
8:22
to like stay there you know i thought
8:24
like if I was in it I can move out and
8:26
then but it would still be ours because
8:27
we occupied it once you know but then
8:30
but then so then I attacked Pickerty
8:32
thinking that um even if we moved out
8:35
well it would still be ours and if we
8:37
didn't move out we would cut support
8:39
from Pikerty to um to
8:42
breast to attack Breast right um so then
8:46
but then it moved us out and then we
8:49
lost Belgium and Breast and then um and
8:54
then I also made another mistake
8:56
somewhere Wait no that was all the
8:58
mistakes Well I do think something
8:59
that's interesting here It's kind of
9:01
hard to see cuz there's a bunch of
9:02
orders happening Yeah I don't even know
9:03
what's going on there Luckily uh what
9:05
happened here is this fleet in Berlin
9:07
tried to move into Keel but both Rur and
9:09
Munich were cut Their support was cut Oh
9:12
that was intentional And you I'm
9:15
guessing you you also helped Austria
9:18
into Munich Was that out of friendship
9:20
or because you knew it would prevent
9:21
them from taking Berlin i mean from KE
9:28
from taking um I don't think they could
9:30
have moved into KE anyways
9:33
No no Um they're he's talking about
9:35
Russia moving into Oh no That was cuz I
9:39
uh Well I told them that we were helping
9:40
them move into Munich but I just wanted
9:43
them to cut their support I see And I
9:46
attacked I attacked Ruer because or we
9:48
we attacked Ruer because um that would
9:50
cut support or um
9:54
and also like it doesn't really matter
9:55
if we leave Holland and then it would it
9:58
would be like
10:01
like since Baltic is already supporting
10:03
them then like you know see I think I
10:07
think the one of All right so my opinion
10:10
is
10:11
like did you did you try and convince
10:14
Austria to attack Russia here
10:19
Austria to attack Russia where like just
10:23
here like they've been they've been
10:24
support holding and being friendly the
10:26
entire time and this was the round where
10:28
that but that bit them in the butt Well
10:31
I've been told I think we've been
10:33
telling them like can you guys handle
10:35
Russia on the east i don't know what
10:37
they've been doing I don't know How do
10:39
they end up with only three centers at
10:41
the end well you're going to you're
10:43
going to find out It is I literally
10:46
texted them this morning at 7:48 and I
10:49
was like "Can you guys do this and can
10:50
you guys like make sure you hold out
10:52
against Russia?" She was texting them I
10:54
saw it and then they were like "Yeah
10:56
we'll do it." Or like "We'll think about
10:57
it or something." And then they just
10:58
like didn't turn in orders Mhm I don't
11:00
know I think I think that might not have
11:02
been purposeful or it might have been
11:03
purposeful That was not purposeful
11:06
Please Kenan Unless it was they just
11:09
like gave up on the game which like I
11:10
understand it's the game I I don't think
11:13
they would do that No one gave I think
11:15
they just forgot Yeah Go go go please
11:23
My hair is really flat That's really
11:25
weird Kenan you're muted
11:28
Sorry about that The So one quick thing
11:32
What was I going to say ooh What are
11:34
your thoughts on Italy moving against
11:36
Russia right here i didn't even see that
11:41
Where italy moving into Russia here
11:47
Oh Uh good for them Good for them Good
11:50
for them I guess I don't know All right
11:53
Not too much to think about Let's move
11:55
on to the next phase where unfortunately
11:59
you don't get a build because you moved
12:00
out of Belgium and Russia That made me
12:03
so mad Like you don't understand how mad
12:06
that made me I think that day I was also
12:09
like at home This was like probably last
12:11
Tuesday or something I think I was like
12:13
at home No no no It was in class Never
12:15
mind But I was just mad And what what
12:18
did you do you were going to you were
12:20
going to explain something and then you
12:21
Oh no no no Cuz I realized it wasn't the
12:23
Tuesday day Ah I see The Tuesday was big
12:26
negotiations but I I think that was like
12:28
last time So yeah Jessica's Jessica's
12:31
been masterminding the game for the last
12:33
like
12:34
like many many rounds because I think
12:37
like I'm just kind of here to like kind
12:39
of like review the orders now Like
12:41
Jessica is like our like is like our
12:43
version of like a All right that's good
12:45
That's good But Amber is more useful
12:47
than the others
12:51
Damn bro Eric is going to put that in an
12:53
interview and then they're going to cook
12:54
you I'm also going to provide the raw
12:57
footage for everybody just so they could
12:58
see everything Oh okay
13:01
Hi Hi Samir I love you guys It's okay
13:04
Yeah No one cares about you At least
13:06
they weren't the ones attacking us At
13:08
least we know that you know Mhm Like
13:10
Yeah
13:12
So I wouldn't say So here's here's an
13:15
interesting thing France successfully
13:17
gets into North Atlantic Ocean Is this
13:20
something you foraw was it a complete
13:22
surprise oh I forgot they could do that
13:24
I forgot that they had naval forces Yeah
13:27
I just like never even thought about
13:29
going up there Like what do you say i
13:30
don't even That's why initially like we
13:32
had the area blocked off but then I
13:33
think I got like distracted and I forgot
13:35
about that We had that area blocked off
13:37
before so that nobody could get in there
13:38
but it's like fine whatever I also al
13:40
also have a question on what your
13:42
negotiations were like with France
13:44
because at this time you're very clearly
13:46
not friendly Were you still talking to
13:48
them like trying We didn't talk to
13:50
anyone in these like past things except
13:52
for Austria I see
13:56
Do you think that was a bad thing or
14:00
just a natural consequence of how
14:02
everything shaped out i think natural
14:04
consequence Natural Yeah I mean like
14:06
even if we had time to talk to them
14:08
about this stuff like I don't really
14:09
know what I what we would say or how we
14:11
would negotiate I think it would just
14:12
make us like more like they weren't
14:14
going to change our minds You know what
14:15
I'm saying and we weren't going to
14:16
change their minds So it was like it was
14:19
just everyone just like we just had to
14:20
like like brute force it out I see
14:25
Well I think we're making good time here
14:27
Um so this is where you end up pulling
14:31
off your move here that you've specified
14:34
earlier Um unfortunately this happens I
14:38
actually I actually have a question
14:39
about this phase Like why did
14:42
you why did you
14:44
see at some point you said you wanted to
14:46
move Sweden to Scatarak right ska Yeah
14:50
Why did you want to move it there
14:51
because it's not Okay
14:54
The original reason was I um well at
14:57
least this was like what I was thinking
14:59
was that we would move to SKA and then
15:02
we would do a so in one move in one
15:06
round right or one t or whatever Sweden
15:10
would move to SKA Edenboro would move to
15:12
Denmark and then um and then through a
15:16
convoy and then in the next one um SK
15:19
would move to the North Sea and then um
15:23
North would move to the helenistic
15:27
HL I see Yeah HL And then that way we
15:31
could support hold KE or we can move
15:34
into KE and then move KE down and like
15:37
it's just there there was lots of
15:38
planning that went into that and then it
15:40
just fell apart And I'm Russia moving
15:44
into Leavonia here was really bad I'm
15:46
guessing
15:48
Uh yeah Yeah it did Yeah And
15:53
unfortunately you lost S because because
15:55
originally we would have been the ones
15:56
moving in to Leon through support with I
16:00
think that that just like I think that
16:01
like that one move where we forgot where
16:03
we messed up on like the Swedish one
16:05
like that I think that kind of threw us
16:07
off I see
16:10
So this was I this is so unfortunate
16:14
This is the fall of the English Empire I
16:16
think this was the day where big
16:17
negotiations happened if I'm not
16:19
mistaken
16:21
Uh I don't think we worked with anyone
16:24
Yeah we didn't really like we've been
16:26
pretty like isolated the past couple
16:27
rounds If you're looking for like some
16:29
kind of
16:30
like these countries are plotting
16:32
against each other you're going to have
16:33
to get that from other countries That's
16:34
not going to be from us Although
16:35
Although this this round I think I I
16:38
told Austria this was on Wednesday I
16:42
told Austria to attack Russia in like
16:44
that bottom area just to make because I
16:48
was telling them I was like okay would
16:50
you rather have because either Russia or
16:53
England is going to win at this point
16:55
Would you rather have Russia win or
16:57
would you rather have England win and I
16:58
was telling them if you're our allies we
17:00
can say that we won together because you
17:02
know like World War I it's not just like
17:05
it's not just England that won It's
17:07
England and all their allies you know So
17:09
I was like "If you ally with us then we
17:11
all win." And then they were like
17:13
"You're going to have to give us a
17:14
better reason If you can get us to as
17:17
many um centers as you guys and we can
17:19
be co-winners then we'll go with it." I
17:21
was like "There's no way." Like you guys
17:24
have
17:26
any like I don't understand But in the
17:30
end they did help us attack Russia here
17:32
in the bottom Oh good for them So they
17:35
were like I don't understand why they
17:36
weren't doing it Um and then
17:41
um oh and then so I spent so long trying
17:46
to figure out I I knew that Brussels was
17:48
going to move to Liverpool
17:51
Um but I think Oh yeah And then I didn't
17:55
realize I thought Pigerty would support
17:58
Bur Burgundy into Belgium Yeah So then I
18:02
thought England oh we can easily move in
18:04
then you know But then they didn't do
18:08
that Um so yeah it kind of just like
18:11
screwed up
18:14
H they they
18:16
they outgued you and that's that's what
18:20
happens between the options They chose
18:22
the one that helped them better Mhm We
18:25
still beat them though And we have one
18:27
more center than them so that's okay
18:28
That is Yeah that is true By
18:30
technicality that is
18:32
true Moving on It's just it's just
18:36
depressing you guys Luckily we just keep
18:38
losing Wait what the heck was Russia
18:40
doing going to Edenboro
18:42
where like wait go forward Oh yeah Yeah
18:45
You see what was that so it's a How did
18:48
they even do that like I don't I didn't
18:49
even know that there was like a channel
18:50
there Like how do they It's a purpose
18:53
It's a purposeful misorder In this case
18:55
Smyrna would just held but he was It's
18:59
funny because like it it shouldn't be
19:02
there He's He's just joking around Oh
19:05
okay Okay A we get it Okay He was like
19:09
He was like "Oh there's nothing for him
19:10
to do." So he just like "Okay I got in."
19:12
So oh my goodness This is the one where
19:15
I spent two hours trying to negotiate
19:17
with Austria
19:19
Okay wait Sorry Go first and then I'll
19:21
talk about it Go ahead and talk about it
19:25
Okay So basically I was like we were
19:28
trying to um I was like the only way
19:30
we're going to win this is that if we
19:32
gain a center and Russia like deletes a
19:35
bunch of centers because at this point I
19:37
know that France is going to take a lot
19:39
of our places Um so then I was telling
19:42
Austria I was like you need to attack
19:44
Munich because that would help us get
19:48
Berlin Yes that would help us get Berlin
19:51
and then we will help you get Munich and
19:52
then Russia will be down two centers
19:54
Plus if you fight them on the west the
19:57
east side then they will be down even
19:59
more centers and then we'll be
20:00
co-winners you know like obviously And
20:03
then they kept asking like "Oh how do we
20:05
know we can trust you?" Blah blah blah
20:06
And then so then they wanted us to move
20:08
into Rur so that they could trust us
20:10
more But look if we hadn't moved into
20:13
Rur then they could have moved into
20:14
Munich How nice you know like I I just
20:18
don't like
20:21
see Jessica was doing all this stuff and
20:22
I was like I was like slaving away at a
20:25
Delta math Like it was like it was
20:27
literally their own demise Like we we
20:30
could have gone we could have in Austria
20:33
England buddies till the end co-winners
20:36
if they didn't ask us if they weren't
20:37
like oh we can't trust you guys We need
20:39
you guys to move into ROR And we were so
20:41
ready to move into Roar And look I could
20:43
have done we could have done so much
20:44
more with the English channel We could
20:45
have moved that back up We could have
20:47
attacked more places gotten back
20:49
Liverpool or something You know you
20:51
could have done so much more if you only
20:52
had time Yeah literally Well if we only
20:55
if we didn't have to move into Brewer
20:56
then we could have done so much more Um
20:58
well you should just lie to them You
20:59
should just told them that we were going
21:00
to move and then like don't do it
21:03
Well I don't know Whatever And then I
21:06
was like well you guys
21:08
just And then okay so at least they
21:11
attacked M because I thought they were
21:13
Berlin and Munich were going to try and
21:14
go into KE
21:17
Um or no I wanted to go into Berlin So I
21:21
didn't want Munich to support Berlin Um
21:24
and that's why I was asking Austria to
21:26
cut off support from Munich And I the
21:29
deal was um you guys cut off the support
21:32
from Munich to Berlin and we go into
21:34
Berlin and then next round we will help
21:36
you guys into Munich from
21:39
Tyr I don't know any country's names Um
21:43
and
21:44
then yeah and then it would have been
21:46
great if we didn't have to move to R
21:48
Series of unfortunate events Extremely
21:51
unfortunate
21:54
All right And it's like why did they
21:56
even you can't even win at this point
21:58
like there isn't there was a chance that
22:00
they could win if they like if if they
22:03
have if they asked France to move into
22:04
Munich or something like that but there
22:06
was not enough I guess there was not
22:08
enough
22:10
there's not enough energy to take out
22:12
Russia they were like oh we could just
22:14
easily get a center but I was trying to
22:16
tell them you don't just get you don't
22:17
just get centers you have to take down
22:19
whoever is at the largest point right
22:21
now and right now that's Russia by so
22:23
much so You guys can get your other
22:25
centers on the east but you also have to
22:28
help us take down Russia around us
22:31
because like if Russia keeps expanding
22:33
into us then you're never going to win
22:35
you know so like you can't just like
22:37
keep building You have to build and take
22:39
down like
22:41
it's fine I understand
22:45
Okay this is the this is the last phase
22:48
here where unfortunately again Simrna
22:52
moves into Norway and Russia
22:56
miraculously stays at 11 which I thought
22:59
was insane and over here is especially
23:03
unfortunate Moscow moves to Warsaw
23:05
countering your move set when you could
23:07
have just supported yourself into Moscow
23:11
Yeah I don't know It's fine
23:16
It's okay Yeah All end You still got
23:20
second That's pretty good You know we
23:23
had gone into Moscow And if Austria had
23:26
read my message this morning and
23:28
followed through in attacking Munich and
23:31
stuff then we could have won Oh well
23:33
it's her first time playing
23:35
O not We couldn't have won but we could
23:37
have like tied with Russia Yeah So needs
23:40
this This is his first time winning He
23:42
needs this
23:43
Yeah this is true If you took if you
23:46
took St Pete and Moscow I think you
23:48
would have won the game You It would
23:50
have been nine to eight in favor of
23:53
England Oh I don't know No wait If you
23:56
if you successfully took Moscow you
23:58
actually No you wouldn't have tied You
23:59
would have gotten to nine because the
24:02
French player took Edenboro from you Oh
24:03
I see that the French have took Eden
24:05
Yeah it would have been tied So yeah but
24:08
it's hard because the fog of war exists
24:11
Um I'm I'm sorry for only being here in
24:14
the very last leg I just got home That's
24:16
okay So true Ernest Fog fog of war
24:20
Whatever Kenan you will send over this
24:23
Yes I will I I you can you can I'll
24:25
visit your house later today I'll like
24:27
come with the flash drive All right
24:30
The So now we're here and the war is
24:35
finally over
24:38
Reflecting on all of
24:41
it what how would you rate your
24:43
performance
24:46
okay Wait can I say something really
24:47
quick because I have to go in like two
24:49
minutes Yes And then um I think we did
24:52
pretty good other than a few mess ups
24:54
Like at the beginning I was like really
24:56
worried cuz I was actually worried about
24:59
Duba and
25:00
Bogia Turkey But like what happened to
25:02
them i don't even know cuz the first
25:06
country that was alo I don't even
25:08
remember like I don't know where they
25:10
went but we never even interacted with
25:12
them in this game and I think like over
25:14
the time Amber and I realized we're like
25:17
wow we're kind of like a big power like
25:19
why are we kind of doing well and then
25:22
you know if this game taught me one
25:24
thing it was that like never like always
25:27
think you're going to win you know
25:29
always like shoot for winning because
25:30
there were so many times when I was like
25:32
uh Why are we even trying at this like
25:34
we're never going to win And like yeah
25:35
we didn't win but like it's fine It was
25:37
It was fun to like at least try win you
25:40
know i think that we did really like I
25:42
think we did really good because it was
25:43
our first time playing And I think that
25:44
like it was really fun I think that at
25:46
the end if I hadn't like if I hadn't
25:47
been like unfocused on the game I think
25:49
that like like maybe like we could have
25:52
done a little bit better But also I
25:54
think that another thing is that I think
25:55
we forgot to capitalize off of our naval
25:58
power And I think that like if we had
26:00
done a little bit more of that around
26:02
the time where I started falling off
26:04
then we could have protected ourselves
26:05
from France a little bit more But other
26:06
than that I think it's fine Uh one more
26:08
question if you're able Jessica real
26:10
quick Do you think that Russia deserve
26:12
to win this game
26:14
no Oh I was going to I was going to say
26:17
that like I feel like Russia deserves to
26:19
win like as much as anybody else Like I
26:20
don't think that there's necessarily
26:21
like I don't know I think I think that
26:24
it is it is automable Ove it is it is
26:28
admirable of Adve Baji to be playing the
26:30
game so many times for him to win this
26:33
one time I think I think he needs this
26:35
One last question I'm really sorry Just
26:37
It's a quick one It's a quick one Let's
26:39
say theoretically you could restart it
26:42
all over again Would you take that
26:45
chance would you want to go at it one
26:47
more time like right now as England um
26:51
I'm burnt out right now but I would want
26:53
to play again eventually Like honestly
26:55
this game has taken out so much in me
26:56
Like it stresses me out I have had
26:59
nightmares about this game Like I will
27:00
be lying in bed and I'll be thinking
27:02
about it I'll be thinking about the
27:03
strategy and I'll be like "Oh I don't
27:04
want to think about it." But like it was
27:06
fun to like think about it you know and
27:08
to have it like occupy my mind cuz I
27:09
think we haven't had like much like
27:11
stress recently and you kind of like
27:13
always need something like pushing you
27:16
you know so I think this was like No
27:18
that's not that's not normal just No
27:21
it's not like it's not like bad like
27:22
anxious stress It's just like like
27:24
thinking like getting your brain working
27:27
kind of stress you know Okay Well thank
27:29
you so much Thank you Thank you so much
27:31

27:33

27:35
