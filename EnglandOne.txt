0:00
i'm ready Okay So let's jump straight into this Uh coming into this even
0:05
though I know you guys are like beginners this is your first game Did you have any initial plans or strategies
0:11
coming into this that you would like to adhere to well all our initial plans were derailed
0:18
because France betrayed us in the first round Yeah we actually did get an offer from
0:24
Italy um to take out France in the first round and move into breast but we were
0:30
thinking that France would at least keep our allyship for the first round So we were thinking that we didn't want to
0:36
reveal our own cards too early but unfortunately I guess that was a mistake
0:41
Was the plan originally for them to support you into Belgium yes Well actually I think for that
0:47
particular plan we realized that France wanted to go for Belgium So we assumed that it would bounce cuz they cuz we
0:53
assumed that um Germany and France and us would all be going into Belgium and
0:59
not that uh Germany would support France into Belgium Yeah So we just assumed it would bounce We we had originally like
1:06
talked with France and we were like "Okay we're going to work together against Germany but then we didn't realize that France was working with
1:12
Germany." So So what if if France did not end up
1:17
stabbing you or betraying you what was your original plan was just to go with them till the end ride or die no we were
1:25
going to we were definitely going to stab them in the back We wanted them to we wanted them for at least a portion of
1:31
the time cuz they're closest to us on the mainland So we wanted to like sort
1:36
of get into sort of the space of um
1:41
Germany with them like that And then we wanted to go with Italy to take out France because Italy did proposition us
1:48
at the very beginning to go against France with them
1:54
Okay So going forward what is the new plan then if this whole France against
2:01
Germany idea isn't going to work well okay So we left France behind and
2:07
now we're working with Italy and Germany to like try and like calm France down
2:14
because they have like a bunch of supply centers that we didn't realize that they got in the last two seasons And then at
2:21
the same time we're trying to just like make Russia back off because they were
2:27
we got word that they were trying to like attack us in Norway Yeah Russia
2:32
actually has proposition to us cuz the reason why we had Norway in the first place is because Russia
2:39
um messaged us at the very very beginning in the first round saying that if they have like if we let them have
2:46
Sweden they'll have let us have Norway and that was sort of like the idea but
2:51
then immediately in the second round they were like hey like if you guys let us have Norway then we'll support you
2:57
against I think they said France like they said like for the rest of the game or whatever But then like Seline from
3:04
Austria was like they made the exact same proposition to them to Austria saying that they would support them for
3:10
the rest of the game if they gave if Austria gave up something else that like Russia had promised them Yeah So I do
3:18
not trust Russia at all Especially not Ave Bajpai A I do not trust you if when
3:25
when you're watching this I do not trust a at all Well it seems less of a distrust of Russia but more of a
3:30
distrust of odd Yeah I don't I don't trust like Mi either I think Mi is too
3:37
smart Samir I'm not saying he's not smart but I feel like he's just kind of there like But like Yeah Mi is up to
3:45
something Yeah And Mi is definitely kind of like she tries to be nice you know
3:50
she comes over she's all diplomatic and she's all nice to you but you know she what her real intentions are So yeah
3:57
we're not taking any deals from them right now In real life I do appreciate all of them but in terms of the game I
4:03
know that they are out to kill As we as we predicted in our Hunger Games
4:09
predictions at the very beginning of the year unit 2 well and especially this team is is particularly made up of unit
4:15
2 is a team that greatly relies on I think strategy and manipulation But I
4:24
think that the issue in this particular case is just that everybody knows that they're manipulators So like how do you
4:30
I think the biggest challenge for Russia I think in this game is going to be how do you manipulate people who know that
4:35
you are manipulating them or trying to so I don't know Well to turn that
4:41
question on its head How do you make sure that people don't see you as manipulators
4:48
i think that that's something that you can't necessarily prevent But I want to see what Jessica says
4:54
Um I'm not sure I mean like right now I feel like our alliance with Italy and Germany is pretty strong because we
5:00
haven't done anything to like backstab them And we're also kind of in like a worse position than them since we can't
5:07
we're not even like we can barely get on the mainland yet And like we have France like completely blocking us from the
5:13
mainland and stuff But I think Russia is not liking us right now because we just
5:19
invaded them in what did we invade them in sweden Sweden In Sweden Germany um helps us get into Sweden in exchange for
5:27
us getting them into I think what was it uh into Belgium Belgium Yes Into Belgium
5:32
We aided them into Belgium Yeah The deal with Germany is sort of the idea that
5:39
they are going to like aid us into breast in the future so that we can get
5:44
in But what I'm seeing right now I know that Jessica said that like our alliance with Italy and Germany is strong but
5:50
what I'm seeing right now is that by the time that they're going to be able to aid us into breast there's going to be no more land in that section for us to
5:55
take So I'm not really sure what we're supposed to do with that You know what I'm saying so I'll keep I think we'll
6:00
keep the alliance with them but I think that the best thing for us to do right now is to see if we can press into
6:07
Russia Yeah I think also like we have to go in from the other side We originally we were intending to go in from like
6:14
from the French side but I think that's kind of impossible right now Yeah we really should have taken that center
6:20
breast when we had a chance but yeah So we were too trusting of Shawn and Alena
6:26
I see So you you mention how like you know
6:32
France is going to die and and it seems like Russia is going to be a big target as well and these were the these were
6:40
the powers that gained the most centers out of the first year and now that they are being sufficiently checked who do
6:46
you think is going to become the next big threat for you guys h
6:52
I think I think Italy honestly because I know that like we have an alliance with
6:58
Italy but it's very clear from the very beginning that Italy did not intend to give us very much I think and I think
7:05
that they are definitely trying to take at least o over like the like um
7:12
southwestern portion of the map and I think they've been very clear about that
7:17
because they were very open was we want Marseilles we want this we want So I think that when they get the chance
7:22
to especially because I think we're weaker right now them and Germany are going to try to push us out Yeah I agree
7:29
I think Italy definitely because they have like kind of um territory over that
7:36
southwestern portion But I think that like if we do stay in the game long enough we're going to have like
7:42
unforeseen conflict with like Austria and wait what's the one next to Austria turkey Turkey Turkey Yeah because we we
7:50
haven't even really thought about them So I feel like we haven't planned like that far ahead and then we're not going
7:55
to see them coming when they come for us I don't trust Austria at all but that's just because it's G and Fel and I know
8:01
that they would think it's funny to come after us It's a funny way to look at it
8:08
So other than Italy then who do you think is currently right now being
8:14
underestimated wait who is Turkey turkey is
8:20
Oh I think like across Do you mean across the map or for us specifically across
8:26
the map Sure Why not across the map
8:32
i think I think it's Austria because I because up until this
8:40
point I haven't heard anybody say one thing about Austria yet because it's like right we were talking to Russia
8:46
because Russia was actually also trying to strike a second deal with us about I think I forgot what exactly
8:53
it was about cuz I told them I would think about it but I was like that's a bad deal so I kind of tossed it on my mind but um Russia was trying to
9:00
struggle their deal with us and they said that they were mildly concerned about Turkey because of I think they
9:07
have a piece of land I think that Turkey is adjacent to So I think that they said they were mildly concerned about Turkey and obviously the western portion of the
9:14
map we're all occupied trying to take out France right now So there's really no one who's watching Austria and I feel
9:20
like at least with what Gabe told me right he was trying to make alliances with Italy and Turkey on the first day
9:26
and you know you know the way that Gabriel is Okay Gabriel if you're watching this you know how annoying you are right so he goes so he goes he goes
9:33
"Okay Amber if you want to go tell everybody that I just want protection that Austria just wants protection in
9:38
the first couple of rounds You can go and do that I'm not doing anything wrong but you know that like you know what he
9:44
means by that." Like he's I think people need to like look at Austria more and I think Italy and Turkey need to take him
9:49
out Yeah I agree I think that like at least
9:55
like from what I've heard like Italy is mainly concerned about France so is Germany Russia
10:02
I don't know what they're doing But um I know they were like trying to make
10:08
some negotiations with Austria but other than that I haven't heard anything about Austria And like looking at the map
10:15
they're they're like very I feel like they're very like they have a lot of
10:20
potential to take over some other countries like supply centers and stuff
10:25
cuz they're very close to like everything So I do know Oh sorry I do
10:32
know though that Russia is trying to get Austria and Turkey to fight each other They're trying to feed them some information to cause some infighting but
10:38
I don't know how At that point I knew that they weren't successful because that's what they told me but I don't
10:43
know where that development is now So you mentioned that in the future that
10:49
Austria could be like is currently the most underestimated right now Do you
10:54
think that you have any diplomatic weight to perhaps resolve this issue
11:00
with Austria well I I mean do you think that you can do anything substantive or
11:06
diplomatically to solve that issue of them being a little bit too overpowered
11:12
and unrealized unnoticed i think that like I think like in terms of like
11:19
working with them I think the way that we would work with them would be like if we cut deals with them to take out like
11:26
Italy or something since like that's kind of in the middle and we can come in from different sides But then in the
11:31
terms of like getting them to fight other people I'm not
11:36
really I don't know how I think Yeah I don't know I think like
11:43
diplomatically I don't I don't think there's anything that we could do right now cuz I think I think we're just too
11:48
concerned right now with even trying to get on the mainland Like I feel like we made the wrong choice with breast and I feel like now we're kind of struggling
11:55
to like even I think even have like a chance of catching up with everybody else cuz I think that at least everybody
12:00
else again is on the mainland And I guess this reflects poorly on me cuz I forgot who mentioned this other but
12:06
somebody was like aren't you an international relations major and I was like yeah Gabriel mentioned that Gabriel mentioned that bro of course it was
12:12
Gabriel bro hate that guy But um I think like at least for
12:20
now like our main concern is definitely finding a way to take out France again on the mainland And I think after that
12:27
we can start thinking about Austria But in the meantime now that you mention it I feel like maybe we should tell Italy
12:33
to like think about that a little bit because at least Italy is a ally to us
12:39
on the surface So it's funny that you mentioned allies because you seem to be
12:45
like not too averse to stabbing your allies You mentioned it very like
12:51
casually like "Hey we're going to have to stab them later." Between Germany and Italy which one do you think you're
12:56
going to stab first and when do you think that that you'll have to stab them probably Germany I think cuz we're like
13:03
closer to them And I think Italy and us could like close in on them or potentially if we could work with France
13:12
again cuz originally our plan was to like be with France and take out Germany
13:17
first but then France backstabbed us So I don't know if we could rework something on that plan when France is
13:24
like less dominant and try to get out Germany then I think we'll probably stab
13:30
Germany first But ideally I think that if it was up to me I feel like we
13:37
would wipe out France entirely first and then deal with the Germany and Italy cuz I do not want to work with France again
13:42
I think that at least I think that like I think that like I think I'm a pretty like loyal person and I think
13:49
that we were at least ready to have a loyalty with France but because they backed us so early that's not a thing
13:55
anymore Like I I will refuse to work with them like outright Even if it means taking out Germany like I I refuse to do
14:01
it How was it that France stabbed you when it was Germany and France that
14:06
worked together to get Belgium because France told us that they would that they would work with us to take out Germany
14:12
but instead they I think they said something to Germany and then Germany supported them into Belgium
14:18
Yeah And like we hadn't talked to Germany so I wouldn't say anything is like backstabbing because like we didn't cut any deals with Germany at that point
14:25
Our deals were all with France and we had planned that like they told us that
14:30
Germany was going to go into Belgium like trying to move in not to support So they were like we'll all bounce you know
14:37
So they were telling us we're going to bounce and then they made us like waste our move to try and get in and then cuz
14:43
we thought it would like help to bounce but no Yeah So Amber you mentioned how
14:50
like you don't see a reality where you would like again work with France while
14:55
Jessica does the uh that scenario Do you think that it could happen if something
15:02
unprecedented like Germany stabbing you were to
15:11
occur i don't think it's unprecedented that Germany would stab us in the back I fully expect them to like I fully expect
15:17
Her and Tommy to stab us in the back but I think that um I don't know I feel like even in that
15:24
instance I don't know if I would want to work with France because I think that but I don't think
15:30
that there's anything on anybody's mind right now except for taking out France So I don't think that before France is
15:37
dealt with that Italy and Germany will do anything against us because they I
15:43
think to a degree they need our fleets to a degree in order to kind of contain
15:48
France So I feel like at least until France is dealt with there's not going to be any
15:55
particular backhanded negotiations between us on that front at least Well when you say
16:01
everyone's eyes are on France do you just mean Germany and yourself in Italy
16:09
basically because that's like all the people who are like near um near France
16:15
and who could like even work towards getting France contained And I think we're like the most worried because like
16:23
or like these three um regions are like the most worried because France is like impeding on like our territories and
16:30
stuff But also when I say that everyone's eyes are in France like even even Russia was looking at France like they've again Russia was trying to cut a
16:37
deal with us about France cuz I think that even they're a little bit concerned about the amount of centers that they have and I think that's because they're
16:43
like they have the most centers right now So I think that they're worried about the potential competition because they were trying to cut a deal with us
16:48
in relation to that So I think that like when I say that everyone's eyes are on France I I really think that everyone is
16:54
trying to take out France Even Austria and Turkey have mentioned like we don't like France Well on that note about how you you you
17:01
said that I could feel a stab coming How can you tell when an ally is about to
17:06
turn into a foe
17:14
i feel like at least when we attacked Russia we
17:20
like we were like "Oh yeah we'll consider it." And then we just like didn't text them after that about like
17:25
any plans So I think that like when people start going dark and when they start like responding with like uh maybe
17:32
or like what ifs or like you know like inconsistent with their answers I think that's when you can kind of tell But I
17:38
think for the most part people are pretty good at like keeping their plans to themselves and like
17:44
um like hiding their information I think I think I'm kind of
17:50
going into this with kind of the mindset that I think that no one is like actually your ally I think that like if
17:55
you're working with somebody for that doesn't mean that it's an allyship That means that you guys are working together
18:01
for one round That's it Like there's no label on it other than the fact that it's just like you guys are working together for this round you know and if
18:06
it ends up happening like I don't I don't think like if it ends up being exactly what the other party says it is
18:12
I still don't think that's like an allyship I think that's just like cuz I know I hear like oh like allyship like
18:18
definition of it is like working together But like I I think that like no like I don't think so Is the distinction
18:23
that you're trying to make about like the nature of alliances itself Do you
18:30
think it's better to have that year-to-year like conditional working together or a more like joined up and
18:38
solid alliance that you can rely on for the entire game
18:43
i think I agree with Amber on this where it's like yeartoyear and like cuz how are you supposed to like know if you'll
18:51
have a solid alliance like Russia offered us a solid alliance but they at the same time they were offering Austria
18:57
a solid alliance and like a bunch of other people So I think like nothing
19:02
that anyone says is like what they mean You know you can't like trust them to actually give you a solid alliance for
19:09
the next few years Mhm I agree with Jessica And well well Keen Dog 111 I
19:15
think that I think that I think I would prefer at least like genuinely I think I
19:22
would prefer to have a long-term alliance cuz I think that like I like the idea of having that like loyalty
19:28
between countries I think I like that But I think that realistically I think it's what Jessica said I think that no
19:34
one no one is going to mean what they say I don't trust that anyone is going to mean like what they say So while I would prefer to have a long-term
19:40
alliance which we initially planning to with France I think it's not feasible Well who do you
19:47
think that long-term alliance would be with which country
19:55
like if I had to pick one well sure And um I guess give us your
20:02
reason why
20:08
Well I think we can immediately like rule out Russia and France because we're already not working with them And then I
20:14
think previously we had said that like Italy were kind of wary about trusting
20:19
as well as Germany honestly because like they're they're pretty close to us So if we want to get on the mainland I don't
20:26
really see how cuz like I feel like we could we would backslide them pretty like quickly
20:33
So honestly like maybe with like some of those countries like that are farther from us um when we eventually like start
20:41
closing in on like the middle countries if we do survive for that long I think that we could have like an alliance with
20:48
like Austria maybe
20:54
Yeah No we don't we don't we don't like Gabe and Slee We redline them Isn't that right Jessica
21:00
we red Don't worry we're going to get them Yeah No I was thinking like Turkey because I think that Turkey is far
21:06
enough from us on the map where like we're not immediate threats to one another but also like it would make
21:12
sense as to like our locations because I think that like a late long late term
21:18
alliance you know like a late like long-term alliance I think that Turkey would make sense
21:24
except for the fact that I feel like Duva and Bogi are also manipulators Like in every single like game of secret hiller like it's always like Duva's like
21:30
he he I'm Duva I'm not I'm not a fascist and B he he I'm Ba I'm not a fascist and
21:38
like you know I think it's like but also like who's not a manipulator you know
21:44
and maybe that's okay maybe it's okay to be manipulator do not get relationship advice from Amber
21:50
note note yourself never I've I've been I've set up many
21:58
healthy and happy couples Okay All right So I have a question pertaining to your
22:04
specific nation of England cuz obviously you do place this value of getting units
22:10
onto the mainland And in order to do that you need a certain balance of fleets and armies What do you think is
22:16
the correct balance there do you want more fleets or do you want to eventually
22:22
get your army count equal to your fleet number i think right now we're trying to rack
22:27
up on the fleets because we do have to like go through the ocean and stuff but
22:32
like once we have fle fleets that can like is it like convoying to the mainland right yeah Once we have those
22:40
like set and like strong then I think we'll start adding more armies so that we can like convoy and then once we're
22:46
on the mainland we definitely want armies so that we can like go inside and like try and get those like inner um
22:53
stations Yeah I agree But I think that like we have at least planned at least for now like Jessica said to like be
22:59
more of like a marine force but you can't rely on that entirely you
23:06
know there's not that many oceans in Europe Like there's nothing like that like goes like like really like in there
23:13
I don't know I guess I guess you're correct in that way Well one time my friend one time my friend was like I'm
23:19
taking she's like I'm taking a cruise in Europe I'm like literally why would you do that like where are you going to go be the Mediterranean probably But like
23:26
other than that I'm saying like where are you going to go like anyways so other than perhaps increasing your land
23:33
presence what do you think is the most important thing for you to do taking out France
23:42
Yeah I think like limiting France and Russia because I didn't even realize like how many supply centers France got
23:48
They got like three the first after like the first like year right and then like Russia also got three and I didn't even
23:54
realize that So I think I like didn't know how this game worked I thought they only like got one Yeah I think it's just
24:00
because we were confused about the way that the game worked Well sorry about that It's okay It's not your fault It's
24:06
not your fault The the way the board is set up is allows for some nations to
24:11
gain more supply centers like France Yeah That's what Italy was warning us about like after the very first like the
24:18
first season before like you like claimed and added your armies and fleets and whatever They were like you have to
24:24
take out France and we were like why would we do that they don't have anything yet And then I didn't realize they already had like two of extra like
24:32
centers and I was like oops I'm praying that I'm praying to Alexis Dtoqueville cuz he's
24:39
brunch Um well actually no that's not gonna work because he's rolling over in his grave right now Yeah he's rolling
24:45
over in his grave Literally he's literally he's saying that this is not democracy in America
24:50
To Thomas Hobbs Yeah bro This is so not And John Lock This is so This is so not
24:57
Wait what's that one this is Oh my god I forgot the citation This is so not Oh my
25:03
god you're losing all your repo knowledge I'll think about it and I'll come back to it This is so not memoirs
25:10
on populism actually No it is because we're poor right now Like we actually have nothing
25:16
Well speaking of that you do have very small amount of centers compared to
25:21
everybody else on the board While everybody else has five you are one of the two that has four Now you already
25:28
Okay Yeah I'm pointing out the obvious You're welcome But obviously Turkey has
25:33
four too Okay All right Sorry nerd Let me just put on the glasses right there
25:39
Anyways so the maybe that's why you want to stick together because you have the same amount of supply Damn it It' be
25:45
true But when it comes to expanding you are obviously going to expand into
25:50
Russia But after that where uh where do you think your first new centers after
25:57
the Russians ones are going to come from are they going to come from old France or are you going to then stab Germany at
26:02
that point
26:09
um I think we're going to try and get into France first Yeah With Germany's
26:17
help maybe But as Ember said earlier like I think by we think like by the
26:22
time that we like are able to even get into France that Germany is going to stab us There's no territory left in
26:28
that area Like literally like what are we supposed to do there's no territory left in that area I think our only choice right now that now that we've cuz
26:34
we abandoned the breast thing on like again a big mistake I think the only thing that we can do is expand into Russia and then come in from never okay
26:42
coming from the coming from the east I have to do I have to do that thing every single time to figure out like northeast
26:48
like southwest but in but like I instead of like the thing where it's like like never eat soggy waffles I always do I
26:54
always do never eat Santa's wife So it's like like why is yours always like related to cannibalism okay Okay No I
27:01
didn't even I didn't even come up with that though Like I some girl told me that in middle school and I was like that's a good that's a good way to remember it Wait so what do you mean by
27:08
coming in through the east though like in through Russia
27:14
direction that we can go like that's literally the only place that we can go unless we I have a question Do you see like on the
27:22
map how are literally how are we supposed to get into like breast or anything like cuz we we can when you
27:28
convoy like the army over you can't like attack from the ship that's convoying
27:35
the army right no that's what I'm saying No Yeah So we can't we unless they like move out somehow and they're probably
27:42
going to attack our English channel and we're No they are bro What are we going to do cuz they can support We We're
27:48
literally screwed So oh wait can we have like two um two
27:56
fleets in one sea no you can't Oh wait What we only have one thing on one
28:01
territory which is what I don't understand Wait so we either need Germany's help or we're going to die
28:07
Yeah basically Well yeah You you you can't conquer one nation by through sheer force You need to have allies Is
28:14
the point of I didn't know that Uh well we learn something new every day
28:21
guys Yeah maybe sometimes teamwork maybe sometimes working with others is good
28:27
Maybe sometimes friendship is good Amber finds friendship in diplomacy Yeah that's
28:33
crazy Ernest do you have any questions anymore sure I have some board specific
28:38
questions Earlier we briefly touched on Norway How do you plan on retaining your
28:44
gains in Sweden that's a good question You know I was
28:50
kind of worried about that I was like I don't know about that But well Russia has to move Oh wait never mind Actually
28:56
they have a fleet I didn't see that I was about to say they have to like move through Finland first and then Sweden
29:02
But then they also have a fleet in the Baltic Sea and then Germany if they want to stab us they could support us or they
29:09
could support that fleet in St Petersburg is on the north coast which means it can go directly into Norway
29:16
Wait Oh yeah On it It looks like it can't go but if you look at the very
29:22
north part it's touching Game Wait So they they're going to take
29:28
that after So that's for you to figure out how to defend the deal Oh wait Does this does
29:34
this newfound uh positional advantage for Russia make you reconsider their
29:40
deals that they have been proposing no No I think I'd rather lose than make
29:46
a deal Well because they were going to ask us they were going to take Norway anyway So like
29:53
like what do we give it to them or do we like try to put up a fight you know I think we can move our like North Sea
29:58
fleet into Norway right To like defend it and then it'll like bounce or like
30:04
it'll stay with us I'd rather fight and lose than strike a deal with Russia Yeah And then we're just like handing it to
30:10
them easily So do you think basically do you think that willingness to fight and almost that that fire to like burn that
30:18
bridge with Russia will affect your game diplomatically well Kenan there was never a bridge in the first place
30:25
Well do you think it's worth it to maybe create a bridge for later
30:31
honestly like maybe because I think like most countries are very wary
30:38
[Music] Oh she's cutting out Uh oh she's frozen
30:44
I think she meant to say that But like you cut out You Yeah you cut out Bro
30:50
can you see can you see yeah we could we could see we can hear you now Restart restart the sentence you were on Okay
30:55
Wait So I think that like because like most countries are like wary of Russia right now I'm not sure how it would work
31:01
but if if we do like make some kind of allyship with Russia that could be useful because like everyone is like
31:09
hands off Russia and stuff Yeah But maybe that would make them hate us So I don't know
31:16
I don't know I think being stuck on a small island is hard and there's no industrial revolution to help us out So
31:22
it's like where where are the where are all
31:27
the colonized people like where are all the colonized areas England like I don't know
31:33
It's a good question Yeah Yeah Maybe if you play Imperial Diplomacy you'll find
31:38
out It's a good point It's a It's a variant that's worldwide and powers like
31:45
England have colonies all over the place They're like purposely larger It's It's interesting Ernest do you have any more
31:51
questions no Um that's about it I think we touched on everything that we needed to touch on
31:59
All right I I have a question for you guys though I want to see what you guys think So in your in your guys's
32:05
experience like what's your favorite country to play as like which country do you think is the easiest to play as ken
32:11
you can go first Okay So I don't want to give away too much because I don't want
32:17
to give an unfair strategic advantage to anyone I I personally love playing as Russia
32:27
Wow Wow No it's You just took away my answer Well it's I The reason Okay you
32:32
can Oh everyone loves Russia No I The reason why I like Russia is because of
32:38
the large presence it has all across the board It needs to play its cards really
32:43
really well Really dip and they need to have a really really good diplomatic
32:48
success in order to do well cuz as you can see they have like borders with four
32:54
countries and their relationships with France and Italy are very important They need to make sure to talk to everybody
33:01
and make you know and perhaps that's why Russia isn't doing too well right now
33:06
They've mismanaged their time They've mismanaged their diplomatic like their
33:12
diplomatic focuses and strategies and thus they are not doing well It's like a
33:18
glass cannon You can do really well or you can do very poorly That's interesting
33:24
Um I guess my second best country to play as is England I actually like the
33:29
isolation and I think the way that England spawns with two ships um makes
33:36
it not only unique but also a um you have specific leverage that
33:43
diplomacy that only diplomacy can fix which is why I like England Do you think
33:49
that we're playing well as England right now or we can't give you that information i'm not going to answer that
33:55
one I'm sorry All right All right All right One last question that you don't have to answer Are we cooked keep dog 111 and earnest Can you just give us a
34:03
Well if I if I like on on the cook meter of like not cooked to like cooked like we're Well the thing is like we evaluate
34:08
that information but we've already interviewed other countries So it would Yeah it'd be Yeah it'd be impartial No
34:15
no no Not based on like what they've said but based on the moves that we've made so far Well like where is it on the
34:21
scale of a usual diplomacy game i don't think I don't think we can answer this one Ernest I will answer that question
34:28
but if you search up England diplomacy moves you can compare what you moved to
34:34
Okay that's interesting Wait is that cheating no I would not consider that cheating Okay we'll consider it then All
34:43
right thank you so much for Thank you so much for taking the time Okay dog

35:20

35:26
this interviews to like make sure that you have all your bases like covered in Yeah It's like a check It's not only a
35:33
check-in but it's not only like to know where your head space is at but it's also to know if you're aware of the many
35:41
pitfalls that many new players to diplomacy like fall into which is
35:48
um very common I guess Okay Thank you Thank you Thanks for
