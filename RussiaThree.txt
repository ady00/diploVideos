0:00
i think I think we ended it off on spring 1905 oh this was an eventful
0:08
year oh yeah this is fun yeah I mean like the
0:15
Russians whoever they are they failed to put in orders and they got really mad that was a terrible call by Ken i will
0:21
say that terrible terrible judges terrible stuff all around yeah but in
0:28
the end in the end other than England walking and straight into N straight
0:33
into St pete there wasn't much consequence here no really no um I mean
0:39
I would consider losing St pete massive import and of massive consequence that's
0:44
a home center of ours but there there was good stuff with that too once the
0:49
English did take St pete they lost all leverage they had over me right which was nice which is nice to have um even
0:56
so lifted off me right even so like the only thing that you lost here was pace
1:03
momentum because Austria also decided to hold all units was there a reason behind that the Austrians are playing very
1:10
slowly and I think that was an issue with just their strategy in trying to appease everyone they've appeased no one
1:17
right i see if you did not if you were able to
1:22
turn in orders this phase what do you think you would have done well I mean I definitely would have gone Finland to St pete i was going to anyways but I would
1:29
have bounced the English out of St pete of course they could go Norway to Barren
1:35
and Sweden to Norway and then start pushing me out of St pete as well but it would be delayed
1:40
otherwise you see it's a good thing actually maybe this was a blessing in disguise because what I was going to do
1:48
was attack the Austrians anyways but by holding off for a turn I could
1:53
consolidate my holdings a bit more right by forcing them out of Munich as well so
1:58
I guess there was a benefit to holding admittedly because it allowed next turn to be that much more vicious a blessing
2:06
in disguise a blessing in disguise perhaps maybe so do you have any other thoughts to
2:12
provide elsewhere on the board what about the war between France and Italy you know good on France good on France
2:19
they are I mean now they're handily beating the Italians um I believe this
2:25
is the turn where the Italian or Italy mentioned that they couldn't turn in orders once i believe it was this
2:30
tournament it was a turn it was a turn before oh okay never mind then but yeah I mean that also caused him to lose his
2:36
solid foothold because Marseilles is going to fall soon too because they've been pushed out of Western Med once they
2:43
get Leon i mean it's all over for the Italians italians are now playing a defensive game and this was the start of
2:48
that push back out of France so the other thing um you I mean I overheard
2:56
you guys you were like kind of pressuring England to attack France and France to defend against England at some
3:02
point um was this now or is that later that was I mean it's been throughout the game
3:08
but it's been ramping up now because I'm going to attack the Austrian it's inevitable i mean we've made relations
3:15
with them but one of us is going to die and I would rather it be the Austrians than me and as a result I would prefer
3:22
if the English are preoccupied with the French and the French preoccupied with the English so the English can't support the Austrians right
3:30
so I would love for them to fight because right now France is considering staying on the offensive against the
3:36
Italians and that is terrible for me because that means that England continues to grow unchecked right and I
3:42
need France to be my buffer against the evil English despotic English hold on a
3:49
second you you say you say the English is a desperate however you're the you're the
3:56
only person who seems to control Russia so if anyone seems to be the desperate on the board it seems to be you do you
4:02
agree with that samir is the brains behind all this i want to stress is the voice piece here samir is
4:09
the real intellectual who's controlling me um I mean Mi doesn't want to play so
4:15
I can't force her to play right and Samir also doesn't want to play so I
4:21
can't I can't force either of them to play a game they don't have interest in right well I think the way that you're playing is unconventional i think I
4:29
think it's a very it's a very good idea i mean like to have a mix of strategies
4:34
in this game because yours is just like grow at all cost england terrorist some
4:40
kind of like virus terrorist england England is like I mean I'll take the better deal austria is like yeah we'll
4:47
go slow italy is like I'm going to freaking attack France and no one's going to stop me and France is just oh
4:53
my god I need to survive till the next day it's so fun you can see the different personalities
5:00
and Okay well here's an interesting question do you think that these personalities have developed on the
5:07
board these attacking and diplomatic personalities do you think they're a nature or do you think by the nature of
5:15
their country and the geography of the board or do you think it's nurture it's how the board state has developed that
5:21
they have developed these personalities you see at this point I would say that where you began doesn't really matter as
5:27
much right some players I mean especially the newer players like the English are very uh dot hungry right
5:36
naturally so I I am too everyone is to a degree but in doing so um they fail to
5:42
see the forest for the trees the trees for the I don't know how you say it the trees for the forest forest the
5:47
trees something like that yeah see the I think it's see the forest forest trees
5:52
That's it right to see it at least right because I'm fine with giving up a center
5:58
or two to gain two centers back in a future turn and the English aren't right so I
6:05
would say that's just because Jessica and Amber are both great players jessica is a great player right um she's never
6:11
played this before and has very quickly obtained the basics of diplomacy right
6:17
but I I still think there is an element of greed to the English and greed is
6:22
necessary in this game right you can't win this game by being an altruistic individual but there is also a fine
6:29
balance between managing greed and managing alliances you have other individuals right you want to have a firm but steady hand in managing
6:36
alliances and of course you want to be the dominant partner in alliances but you also don't want to be too dominant
6:41
and force them to rebel against you right it's a very fine act that I myself
6:48
don't know how to do very well which is why much of my alliances end up falling apart well it has worked out for you so
6:54
far we move on let's move on to the next phase which I think is very interesting
6:59
because this turn you got French and English support into an Austrian territory i did while English is all the
7:08
English is in one of your centers i know right what a shame so the English have
7:13
continued to attack me um but the issue is I can't do much and luckily they can't do much either right because once
7:19
they've taken St pete from me especially with this fleet up here in North Coast they can't make any further inroads into
7:26
Moscow or Seb just because that fleet north coast is it's done once you've taken St pete you've taken St pete it's
7:32
very difficult to push past that and as a result I can't lose more from the English and the English can't gain more
7:38
from me at least for now so it's good for me at least that I mean once I've
7:45
lost St pete I now have no tether to the English because they can't threaten me
7:50
anymore right they've already threatened me enough and taken everything I have to lose to them so as a result it's only a
7:57
relationship that can foster now based on mutual trust for the most part so
8:03
again the Austrians have continued to play very slowly and that's to their detriment because they chose to hold the
8:09
majority of their centers they didn't even try to like if I were the Austrians I would hold Serbia i I would hold
8:15
Romania with Serbia and Bulgaria and Budapest but they refused to do that as well just held normally which is very
8:22
trusting of me which I loved um probably misplaced trust um but that's why you
8:29
can't you know not defend yourself at least you can't not support hold yourself in this game you have to at
8:36
least have some veneer of tactics when you're making moves just to avoid threats like these
8:42
so the so I think the other interesting thing here is that even though you took rum you took mun with support from the
8:50
English and support from the French that Austria got more mad at the English than
8:56
they were at you i know why do you think Why do you think that happened you be the Austrians and
9:03
the English were trying to work something out you see I've been fighting the Austrians since the dawn of time rum has been changing hands ever since 1901
9:11
it was the Turks at one point it was ours at one point it was the Austrians at one point now it's ours again i mean
9:16
there's just been so much conflict there that it's not a surprising stab it's a stat nonetheless but it's not surprising
9:22
from the English though that's unique because the English actively worked to sabotage the Austrians here and it was
9:28
the English who offered this deal to me as well the deal of me going into Munich and I took it i mean I love that deal
9:34
but the English in this case were the um this was their brainchild and as a
9:40
result the Austrians were upset at it because I mean us fighting them is
9:47
natural the English fighting the Austrians is unexpected because one would expect the English and the Austrians being on separate sides of the
9:53
board to be natural allies but they weren't right so it's good for me
9:59
all right is uh so let's see
10:05
here what okay so I think I think in order to ask ask this next question we
10:10
need to move on to the next uh board state do you have anything else you'd like to comment on here I mean do I
10:19
don't think so uh good job France on pushing them out of Leon as well
10:24
Marseilles is going to fall soon England just took Finland I mean not surprising but yeah it allows a double build which
10:31
is nice i I'll take that but yeah nothing crazy all right so here a couple interesting things
10:39
happen for on the build phase the English build an army in London and you
10:46
have a fleet destroyed in Greece which I think is very interesting
10:52
they could have chosen to destroy Burgundy but instead they chose to destroy this fleet which could have actively attacked you over here which is
11:00
wonderful which is you know the moment they said they would destroy Fleet Greece rather than destroy Army Burgundy
11:05
was the moment I had this massive sigh of relief because it meant that all of a sudden Turkey was safe right all my
11:12
Turkish centers were safe um and it was a great sign of peace i also think a bit
11:18
of deception was used i told them that fleet grease couldn't support hold Bulgaria it definitely could oh my god
11:24
you devil you devil cuz it can i know it
11:30
yeah they didn't know that which is great uh is it unfair because I know this game and they don't yes i mean I I
11:38
mean just props to you cuz I would not dare do that i I have some sort of
11:44
decency to at least tell them the rules correctly i I guess it's fair but like
11:49
you're going to have to use rules to my advant because you put me in this spot Ken you prevented me from making moves with not one turn so this is all your
11:56
fault really i'm going to keep I don't think Yeah Kenan's fault i don't think that's I don't think that goes against
12:01
the rules just damn you slimy i mean like you're such a slimy player of course of course you do that weren't you
12:08
one of the people weren't you one of the people that was also like "No Kenan don't reveal like uh
12:16
advanced tactics to everybody else please don't do that that's the one thing I have yeah don't do that
12:23
um but yes I mean they were feeling like destroying Greece anyways i just gave
12:28
them further fuel to the fire right because they wanted to keep our they were at this moment they were on very
12:34
rough relations with the English um Gabe and Selena are very proactive i mean they've been
12:40
playing this game with honor and as a result they expect other people to play with honor as well right and the moment the English betrayed that honor by
12:46
supporting us into Munich because they know I don't play with honor that's been established right but the English not
12:52
playing with honor was very surprising to them them supporting me into Munich was a great stab to them and as a result
12:58
the the Austrians took it as a great affront and thankfully they chose to
13:04
keep Army Burgundy to maintain that conflict with the English which is great
13:10
for me it's wonderful what is so why do you think I'm I'm kind of confused
13:16
because like you say that the English playing with honor is something that everyone assumed right but if we look if
13:22
we look back until the early years like over here in fall 1901 the Sweden stab
13:30
not this not the Sweden stab but like you see down here with the France and
13:35
German triangle France supports France is supported into Belgium by Germany in fall Oh yeah the next time the English
13:43
support Germany and the next time France support the English into Belgium it's so
13:49
interesting yeah yeah this whole thing you think that's playing with honor i would not interpret it that way at all i
13:55
don't No one on this board should be playing with honor in the English especially but people on this game have
14:00
short-term memories right and no one remembers or cares as to how the Germans fell it just happened and since the
14:07
Austrians benefited from the Germans falling by them taking Munich it was good for them in the long run right as a
14:12
result in the eyes of the Austrians it was playing with quote unquote honor because they didn't stab them directly
14:18
as soon as the English did stab them it's at that moment that the English lose all semblance of honor they might
14:25
have right and that's how most of this game works everyone plays with honor until they attack you directly so here's
14:31
so this is an interesting point of the game I think because we're at the point where you have nine centers and England
14:37
has nine centers combined that is 18 centers a majority of the centers on the
14:43
board did you have any like idea or
14:49
perhaps desire of you and England teaming up and just absolutely dominating the rest of the board because
14:55
you have the majority of the forces it would never work as the issue it would never work because both I know the
15:01
English at this point at this point in time and as we'll see in the next turn too the English were going to move against me they were going to at least
15:08
try to convince Austria to kick me out of Munich and as a result it was my responsibility to talk to the Austrians
15:14
first and make sure that they kick the English out of Q right because the English will never work with me and I
15:20
will never work with the English at least we might maintain appearances obviously but it'll never happen just
15:25
because we're both very untrusting powers and having a majority of centers on the board we're naturally going to
15:31
come into conflict so it's both of our responsibilities to utilize proxy countries like France and Austria to
15:38
uh receive and obtain our objectives on this board funny you say proxy countries
15:44
like France and Austria there is an odd nation out there in that sentence
15:51
so I I mean just from that sentence alone it seems to me that you think Italy is done for is that true
15:59
they're not done for but to play Italy is very difficult in this game because naturally you have three powers in the
16:05
west the Germans the English and the French and you have three powers in the east the Russians the Austrians and the
16:10
Turks and you have the Italians added to the mix to stir up chaos and as a result it's very imperative that the Austrian
16:16
that the Italians play as I would say pirates right they need to steal centers they need to poach centers and the
16:24
Italians have tried trust me they have tried to go after the French but it
16:30
hasn't worked for them and now they're in a place where they've lost Marseilles they only have four centers in a world
16:36
where everyone has like six or six or above seven or above and naturally they are going to fall because I have been
16:42
telling the Austrians that hey either the either the Italians fall fall or you fall i would much rather the Italians
16:48
fall than you fall of course of course and I told the French the exact same thing it's either you fall or the
16:54
Italians fall and you know one of you has to die inevitably right they are the
16:59
next Germany they're the next Turkey and so they are the weakest of the powers and so I think they are done for yeah
17:07
okay let's move on to the next phase where again you decide to attack
17:14
Austria actually kind of planned out so wait hold on sorry pause a what did you
17:20
say can I get whatever just happened cuz my sister in my room so I muted so saying um your recording on this will
17:27
probably be the better one yeah okay all right um so here couple interesting
17:32
things happen you have Austria moving to Rur supposedly to help you out with Keel
17:38
but you also attack Bulgaria here what's the deal with that Obe if this
17:45
one was Okay this one was kind This one was actually kind of planned so an outside viewer would obviously see this
17:52
as me invading the Austrians and me betraying them right and so did most of
17:57
the board and so did the Austrians but then on the day this turn happened we
18:03
got on a call me gave him Zeline for like half an hour and just planned out so I gave them back if you look at the
18:09
next turn I give them back Bulgaria but the English don't know that the French don't know that the Italians don't know
18:14
that as a result in the eyes of the English the Austrians and I are at odds therefore it makes no sense for the
18:21
Austrians to help me and to kill right it makes zero sense at all that's perfect because once the English think
18:29
that the Austrians and I are on bad terms the English will use Holland
18:34
rather than defending Keel to defend Belgium instead because I will convince to the English because I'm right now
18:40
allies to the English i've moved out of Berlin that hey the Austrians are going to move towards Belgium with French help
18:45
you should use Holland to support Belgium and as a result the English would never see the actual attack coming
18:51
upon Ke right m so me going to Bulgaria
18:57
was like a gambit to make the English think that we would actually never go
19:04
for KE because the Austrians and the Russians at this point in time could never work together i just took Bulgaria
19:09
but but we like reverse psychology them and did work together next turn we gave
19:14
them back Bulgaria and in return they got Munich and we got Ke in Berlin again so why dabble in all these smoking
19:21
mirrors when you could just take Austrian dots and have that be done and
19:26
over with the issue is I need the Austrians still i really do because if you look at the board state right now if
19:33
the English and the Austrians continue to work together they will kick me out of Q and they will kick me out of Berlin
19:39
and that will just happen and I would kill the Austrians yes but I would lose some of my centers and the English would
19:44
gain Germany as a strong foothold and they'd just win so as So if I can make
19:50
the English and Austrians not trust each other which I'm really trying to do because the English and Austrians did
19:56
have a stableish relationship prior to this if I can make them not trust each other and make them doubt every word
20:02
they say that's only good for me right because in the turn after this um during
20:07
the actual diplomacy stage of diplomacy um I told the Austrians to try to work as much with the English as possible to
20:15
alleviate any concerns they might have in Kio and then obviously the Austrians went ahead and stabbed the English so it
20:22
showcases to the English that no one is to be trusted even the Austrians and that's only good for me and I'll try to keep playing at that relationship until
20:29
fall comes of this year in which case I will take Austrian centers i like how that I like how that scenario is good
20:34
for you because everybody already assumes that you're a dirty trickster but to make everybody else think that
20:39
everybody else is a dirty trickster exactly you know that levels the playing field it has the same energy as if
20:45
everyone's a traitor then no one is you know we got a little syndrome over here but for diplomacy
20:54
okay um Oh yeah the next move in the fall is probably the best move this board will ever see the best the best
21:01
the best turn this board will ever see for the first time oh my god this is my master stroke this is a It's like a
21:08
choreographed dance a very Yes it is it is a dance the same way Hannibal had
21:14
Kenna and the same way Napoleon had what did Napoleon
21:19
have for instance he had ostletits this is my ostletits this is my Ka this is my
21:26
Oh my god what wow it's cinema it really is cinema the entire because even if the Austrians
21:33
stab me in the next turn or if the English somehow corner me and I lose everything this will be the pinnacle of
21:39
diplomacy oh my god cuz you cuz you have manipulated everybody on the board successfully to move against the English
21:46
oh my god wow and it worked too i can't believe it oh my goodness of course there's there's these two over here in
21:51
their own separate bubble so I mean like but even they kind of helped too because the French were in on this the French
21:57
moving back to Belgium was purposeful because I to I told the English that hey you got to support the French into
22:03
Belgium from Holland in turn diverting Holland support Ke forcing Ke to lose
22:09
its center and additionally Berlin fell too berlin had to disband because there was no place to go it was just great it
22:16
was perfect it was great yeah
22:23
so you know it's funny that you mention all these great conquerors Hannibal and
22:28
Napoleon because all of them had their downfall at some point even after their masterpiece their master stroke whatever
22:35
you want to call it yes but you see Kenan they got they they the Napoleon got captured because everyone else in
22:42
Europe like seven nations teamed up against take them down and he beat them like five times five coalition wars and
22:48
he beat them I think what the first four times well yeah and then and then like they they they named the war after him
22:55
like one dude right the Obe wars imagine well I don't think we're too far off
23:02
from a reality like that now you are the dominant power in Europe with 10 centers
23:09
twice no not twice two more as many as the next person
23:14
so when do you think that they will see past your little games and deceptions
23:19
and realize that the real enemy is the purple menace over here that everybody needs to find out it's going to happen
23:26
very soon it's going to happen i wouldn't be surprised next turn you see I will try to convince the Austrians
23:33
that hey Austria move against Italy else I will take Bulgaria for real this time and I will continue to hold the yoke of
23:39
Bulgaria over their heads until they will you know begin to see through
23:45
me because I will I'm going to lose Munich or Ke or Berlin this turn maybe all three right i'm going to lose some
23:52
combination of those because Munich's open and I did offer Munich to the Austri for some reason the Austrians never took Munich last turn but that was
23:58
all theirs to take so I will lose probably Munich this turn and if the English choose to work with the French
24:04
properly this turn I will lose KE as well right and if the Austrians really want to work with the English which they
24:11
might I'd hope they don't because I'd like to believe that relations between the two are strained they could take Kea
24:18
from me as when I would lose everything but I hope that I can convince the
24:23
Austrians to move against Taiia and move into the Italian centers and be occupied with fighting another army to force them
24:30
to look at a different enemy rather than me and in the meantime I'll take Bulgaria from them and Budapest from them and just you know poach centers
24:38
what do you think is the most important thing for you to do moving forward
24:44
maintain great relations with everyone i've been talking to the English and I've been telling them hey Ke can be
24:50
yours too just don't move anywhere else and don't talk to the Austrians and I've been talking to the English hey move into Mid-Atlantic Ocean and fight the
24:56
French i've been talking the French hey France england's moving into MAO i heard this from them you should watch out i've
25:02
been trying to rile up wars between every single power so I can continue to maintain the illusion that hey I'm not
25:08
the true enemy until I gain some more centers in which case it will be very obvious but I'd like some more centers
25:14
before that happens so how confident in how confident are
25:19
you that you can sway the Austrians to attack Italy here relatively because you see with Austria
25:26
I have this very like tight death grip over them in their home centers if Austria isn't able to if Austria doesn't
25:34
move towards Tyia this turn I've just told them flat out I will take Bulgaria right and they'll gain Munich but
25:39
they'll lose Bulgaria and they can't do anything about it so it's in their best interests to go for Tyolia and go for
25:46
Venice and support me into Denmark or support the French into Holland or whatever because otherwise I'll just
25:52
take centrist from them and in doing so I've to a degree vasilized them by force just by threat of taking Bulgaria the
25:59
issue comes when I do take Bulgaria and then I have no more leverage over them and we'll see what happens when that
26:05
comes so do you think that if there were fears
26:11
about you that they are completely justified that you are leading this game
26:17
well I mean I am right because I have 10 centers so right now I'm board top and board top is going to be targeted
26:23
naturally and it's the responsibility of every other player to bring board top down by a peg or two and right now that
26:30
means taking some of my centers away the same way we beat back the English last turn that same thing is likely going to
26:36
happen to me this turn hopefully it doesn't and if it doesn't I might just win this game but if it does then we'll
26:42
be just blocked in this endless war over and over again and we'll see what happens yeah so here's the next question
26:47
how do you break that cycle how do you make it so that you reach 18 supply centers before the rest of the board
26:53
decides that hey we need to keep you in check i need time i need time i need everyone to fight each other right i
27:00
need the English to fight the French and I need the French to fight the English i need the Austrians to fight the Italians
27:06
all will I continue to grow for the next year or two if that happens then I will win and if that doesn't I won't win it's
27:11
just that simple so this is an odd question but do
27:17
you know about you know about stalemate lines right yeah yeah i mean I don't
27:23
think I have enough centers yet to reach a stalemate line i think they can still beat me back because the English are
27:28
very strong no but I could see that yeah I was just wondering because like this
27:34
whole situation up here the Barren and the St petersburg army here that is Yeah that's a stalemate right there you can't
27:40
do anything about that and they can't really do anything about that either without exposing St petersburg
27:47
so when it comes down to it do you think that you would share that information with other people in order to stop
27:54
somebody else um I I will keep telling the Austrians hey England's in my
27:59
centers they're the biggest threat to me therefore we should all fight back against English because look they took
28:04
my home center and they're going to take Moscow soon i will keep propagating false not false trumped up information
28:12
to them to make it seem like I'm the you see I'm really good at playing the victim in this game and I love it it's
28:17
so fun i'm really good at playing the victim that's the one thing I do have that's the reason why I've been able to warm myself out of this stuff because
28:23
I'm really good at seeing like and seeing my at making myself You're such a little weasel man that's so funny it's
28:32
so fun it's great uh but yeah by making yourself look like the victim you can
28:38
win this game right because everyone thinks that you're losing the French the first thing they told me was like "Hey
28:43
you are winning but you lost one of your home centers wow that's crazy he kind of like fighting with the English right like optics is the entire name of this
28:50
game and I need the optics to make it look like I'm a tragic country that's going to lose everything to the uh
28:57
doineering of English right do you think that your ability to fight England has
29:03
been sufficiently like I don't know like sufficiently hampered by the capturing
29:10
of St petersburg you can't build any more fleets in that area anymore because of that it's actually quite nice because
29:17
the English can't take more from me either the same way I have like this
29:22
like threat of taking Bulgaria from the Austrians the English have always had this threat of taking St pete from me
29:29
and now they've capitalized on said threat very early I would say and now there is no longer any threat against me
29:35
so now I can have just Moscow hold back St pete and Barren and they need to
29:41
commit two troops over here or they are committing two troops over here for my one troop up here and it's just a good
29:48
exchange for me right mhm all right do you Ernest do you have
29:54
any questions for Obe um no
30:00
obe i do wonder if um you think that St pete
30:07
will advance cuz they have an army in St pete which is scary truly it is but I
30:13
think for the rest of the game I'll have Moscow top St pete st pete probably go to Levon or something i'd like to keep
30:21
Warsaw in Warsaw or rather I'd like to keep Sev in Seb so I can always cover
30:26
Moscow and if they are to move St pete down to Levonia or into Moscow I'll
30:32
somehow or like if they move St pete to Levonia then Moscow is going to get St pete maybe barracks are going to bounce
30:37
into St pete north coast but regardless St pete is going to be empty and I'll either stay in Moscow or I'll be in St
30:44
pete right so it'll be good for me they need two armies is what they need if they need army Leavonia to actually make
30:49
a threat happen and that's not happening anytime soon either okay so do you have any questions for us
30:58
no that's all I have actually what are what is everyone else doing no unfortunate we cannot give you that
31:06
information shame shame all right well yeah wait everyone's like plotting against you at home i probably are i
31:12
can't I can't live either we uh This is a good talk this is fun i'm glad you're
