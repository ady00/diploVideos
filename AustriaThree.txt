0:01
this game is getting serious It's getting intense It sure It
0:06
sure is Well we could start off How about Yeah we could just jump straight into it This is spring of 1905 where we
0:14
left off last time And this is an interesting order phase because Ove
0:19
failed to turn in orders here Do you think that this was Do you think this is a blessing in disguise because he could
0:26
have he could have immediately went for your centers here do you think that's something he was considering
0:33
It wasn't even a blessing in disguise It was just a blessing Honestly it was no cloud with silver It
0:39
was just a silver cloud Yes exactly
0:45
Yeah I think I think he definitely this was kind of a a nice break for us
0:51
because we didn't get any attacks from the Russian side and it kind of got us
0:56
to or it allowed us to think about what our next move was going to be a little bit more Um although we did
1:04
experience a setback later This was a nice Yeah it's coming up Well the I
1:10
think actually I think it's very interesting because up until this point like you and Russia have been like at
1:18
like at each other's throats What do you I mean I guess it takes a lot of trust
1:23
to really become friends with your enemy So what what do you think
1:30
motivated you to do it like what was the special circumstance that allowed you to do that
1:37
for me I thought it's cuz we had no other choice We pretty much had to make
1:42
allies with them or then for ourselves Hold on
1:50
Yeah Basically it was a choice between allying with the people who literally Oh
1:58
okay Sorry the people who literally betrayed us like 5 seconds ago or go
2:03
with the person who we have a little bit of animosity with but who is going to give us a better shot at surviving like
2:10
I thought I think at that point it was just about surviving and like staying alive for the next round Um and I think
2:17
the only way for us to have done that is to kind of go with somebody who's strong and who's open to allying with us And I
2:24
think that Russia has always been pretty open and like we said in the earlier interviews like we were always open to
2:29
allying with them even though at the time we weren't like like begging them
2:35
like this time we were kind of like okay it's kind of in our best interest to do so and keep us alive for as long as
2:41
possible Okay Well I I feel like we should wait until Gabe gets back But your other ally
2:50
the one that you know you've been with for longer and I would argue that you
2:56
have a better connection with I mean like they're not Italy I
3:02
mean they're not fairing too well in their front against France Do you feel
3:08
like this is a good thing bad thing uh like what are your general thoughts
3:13
like I think it is kind of a bad thing and we have been talking about um maybe
3:20
considering you know loosening our friendship a little bit to you know kind
3:26
of lead us into a new allyship or lead us into a new path just because right
3:32
now I think we were talking about this before but like or me and Gabe were talking about this before but like Italy
3:40
we've been very loyal to them we've stuck by their side throughout all these rounds Um but they haven't re really
3:47
given us that much of like a benefit other than just not attacking us which
3:53
like right now basically what our like relationship is is that we just don't attack each other But the thing is like
3:59
that's not really helping us gain anything So and also the Italians are being heavily attacked by the French and
4:07
so they're losing centers and they're not helping us gain any centers So I think like right now it's not really the
4:15
best It's not the best look right now So I think in the future it is wise for I
4:20
think it would be wise for us to maybe consider trying
4:26
to I don't know once once it gets to a certain point where it's like there's no return for them I think that that'll be
4:33
the point where we have to ask them like hey I don't know if this is the best relationship for either of us right now
4:40
none of us are really thriving And yeah right now I think that they're not
4:45
really thriving and they have been super reluctant to get like to have any sort
4:51
of relationship with France which I do think is unwise and is hurting them I think honestly ideally it would go
4:59
something like a little bit what happened with Turkey where like they kind of know they're cooked but since we
5:07
were loyal with them to the end they kind of like commit suicide in a
5:12
way that helps us out I think you know if they keep losing
5:18
territories it might come down to that sooner rather than later And I would personally I think it might be strategic
5:24
for us to still remain loyal because if we backstab them at the last second but they don't quite die then we're going to
5:31
be their enemies forever you know So yeah Um obviously we have a lot else
5:37
going on I don't think we have the the time and energy to help them out right
5:42
now But do you think that there that's what it might come down to do you think that there's any possibility that if it comes
5:49
down to it they can help you out with Russia with their coastal fleets down here in Turkey
5:56
i think that is a possibility I definitely do think maybe once like
6:01
France and them maybe sort something out or maybe if once like they can weaken
6:08
France possibly and maybe we can help them with that and get France out of the way then maybe they can go over and help
6:15
us with like the Turkish area with their fleets But I do think that at this point they're so occupied with trying to push
6:22
back against the French that they're really they have no like lenience to go help us anywhere else Yeah that's Nathan
6:29
offered us that Um but yeah like Seline said and Nathan
6:34
acknowledges too like right now it's just not a possibility but eventually we would love that you know
6:41
So clear now we're getting I think this we're getting on to the most interesting part of this this week in my opinion and
6:49
it'd be like the the crapshoot that happened in Germany like that whole scenario I was eating that up like if I
6:56
had a popcorn bucket it'd be gone because like all right first it starts
7:02
out with this and this down here So please I think you should just take the
7:08
wheel Talk about what you want to talk about right now And I mean I don't know if I don't know if by the time this
7:14
interview is going on we're going to remember it I mean I think we will but yeah
7:20
basically England and Russia inspired against us Russia took
7:26
Romania after he after a said that he was going to move up and defend against English And then on top of that we felt
7:33
extremely betrayed by Jessica helping them displace us in Munich So that was
7:40
and we lost two territories in one round We got super mad We went around the classroom yelling
7:48
"Kill England." We wrote on Denimore's board "Kill list England." Yeah
7:54
Um that's that's what it was We were really not expecting for that to happen at all And it was kind of like
8:02
um if you watch Star Wars that was like our order 66 moment
8:07
Yeah Like basically what happened was that both of them tried to strike a deal with us So like Russia was like hey if
8:14
you help us into I think it was Keel Yeah They were like oh if you help us into Keel then we we'll like we'll give
8:22
you um what is it Warsaw later or something like that But then Britain was like "Hey if you guys help us into
8:29
Berlin." Berlin Yeah Then we will give you Keel or something like that later
8:34
Like so both of them were trying to get us to like side with them And at that point um I in my mind at first I was
8:41
like "Hey why don't we just help the English right cuz like you know Russia's looking strong and it can't hurt to help
8:47
them." But then um later I mean me and Gabe like really talked so much about
8:52
this like the entire period we were like going back and forth Should we attack should we side with one of them and attack or should we just not get
8:59
involved and kind of like go attack the French or just like defend against the French like something like that and so
9:05
like what we settled on was like we were like "Okay you know what like I feel like it's a little dangerous to try to
9:10
side with either of them So let's just tell them both be honest and be like "Okay we're not going to take either of
9:16
your deals We'll just stay out of it You guys do what you're going to do." And then we went and went in the French area
9:22
And then and then I just I didn't I wasn't expecting this at all They turned on us and planned with each other
9:28
against us which was like I don't know it felt like the ultimate betrayal because it felt like we were like giving
9:34
out the olive branch of peace and then they stabbed both of like they stabbed
9:39
us after we said that we were going to be peaceful Like it just felt so wrong and so like it's it felt like they had
9:46
you know they had stabbed me in the back for reals But then honestly I was very mad at first but then later I was like
9:53
you know what I said this myself like this is this was my own naive like this was me thinking that we'd be fine if we
10:00
just stayed out of the conflict but you know what I've learned now is that like given the chance to attack or like you
10:07
know try to gain a a territory or center we cannot give that up anymore like we
10:12
have to side with one person or the other if it if we want to stay strong and alive in this game or else the
10:19
people who are trying to get our support are going to are going to turn and get each other's support against us Yeah No
10:28
longer the passive players I assume No No more No more rounds where we just hold everything Yeah No more Yeah Which
10:35
is also the reason why this Ukrainian attack worked You had three units
10:40
bordering Rum Either of them any Don't remind me Don't remind me Could have brought any support onto Rum But the
10:47
fact that you chose to hold opened this whole like I mean if there's anything
10:53
good that came out of that is that it we use it as a strong bargaining tool against a because we were like that
10:59
shows that we trusted you and that's what you did for us So I think obviously
11:04
it sucks that we lost Rome but next round when we got Bulgaria too we I think we were able to leverage that and
11:10
have him give us Bulgaria back All right So you know I think what's funny about
11:17
this is you are more mad at the English for throwing a support order at Russia
11:23
than Russia for taking two of your centers I don't understand that Can you please explain that maybe maybe it's cuz
11:28
Jessica is our unit mate or because we felt like she was on our side a little bit more But
11:34
we like this thing We had been expecting we had known for a while that
11:40
Audrey was a sneaky little backstabber right from day one So it wasn't that much of a shock I think we were more
11:48
emotionally ruffled because it was Jessica and because we it was completely
11:53
unexpected Yeah For Romania like that's the hundth time that we invade they
11:59
invade we invade they invade Like it's it's whatever We're used to it now And the part that gets me is like I was like
12:05
Jessica why would you come after us instead of going after either the French or weakening the Russians like what what
12:12
did we do to you first of all second of all what do you what do you have to gain like first Russia gained way more from
12:17
that bargain than England So like they just literally they stabbed us for basically no reason Just and then it
12:24
only made me faulty towards them So I was just like I was just not I was not
12:29
it was just not a smart play I mean it was a smart play but like emotionally wasn't a smart play
12:36
Yeah Jessica's reasoning which to me then I thought was silly was
12:42
um that we didn't make a deal with them which I guess is technically true but it was heavily implied We were heavily
12:49
discussing peace and then just because we went away to discuss and we didn't like shake on it that was her reasoning
12:56
which I thought was quite silly But yeah All right let's move on to the next
13:02
phase where you have unfortunately you must
13:07
destroy your fleet in Greece What made you decide to destroy that fleet in Greece rather than any of these
13:14
isolated armies well um
13:21
because we knew there was pretty much our most isolated ones were Burgundy and
13:28
Greece And this is when it came down to this was the round where we were like we
13:33
either you know stick our egos aside and work with Russia a little bit um and trust them
13:42
one last time or it's just every man for himself now and then we kind of we
13:48
thought that was like a lower chance of us coming out on top So we decided to put our egos aside work with Russia as
13:53
an act of further trust which thankfully this time paid off We got rid of our
13:59
flee in Greece and we formulated our plan which is coming up We formulated
14:04
our plan which relied on the army in Burgundy to push back the English Um and
14:11
that was also based on the promise that we would get Mun back which we did So it
14:17
was it was an act of trust a leap of faith if you will But that's what it was
14:22
I think this at this stage we were like we needed to do something a little bit risky because if we just kept playing it
14:29
safe we would just slowly fall out of power That's the energy I like that
14:34
energy All right moving on to this next phase So a couple of interesting things happened What happened to the deal why
14:42
is he moving into Bulgaria again guys oh no Oh no
14:47
Yeah let's be honest Yeah I just think he
14:52
can't even help himself you know like if I don't I don't He said he said I need
14:58
territories which like I guess is true but he then what's it called um he gave
15:03
it back to us So I mean I guess that makes sense It's just to build an army
15:08
But whatever There's not much we can do about it obviously Um so we refused agree We got we got it
15:16
back next time But this is when our our deal was still in the stages of being formulated
15:25
Actually I take back what I said before In the past round when we made that decision to get rid of Greece we still
15:31
hadn't fleshed out the deal It was this turn that we started doing that Um that previous turn we were I think we were
15:38
hoping to attack France weren't we yeah I think so I think so So and then here
15:43
we we took the opportunity and this was our leap of faith moment where we were like "Okay they just attacked us again."
15:49
But he promised us Munich He promised us um Bulgaria So yeah that was that So you
15:57
said you were going to try and attack France Why' that change i think it changed because honestly like we talked
16:03
to Adve and he lowkey convinced me and like not just because he's a great convincer just it's actually because I
16:09
started to believe it myself Like I I saw the merit in it It because he started saying like "Hey France is like
16:16
the last line of defense against England If we let France fall then England will win this game cuz they can go into
16:22
France and then they can go into Italy and then they're going to eventually come after us." So I was like you know
16:28
what that that that's kind of right cuz like if we kill France right now um or
16:34
like I don't know we let England have France which was kind of like it wasn't the plan to let England take France but
16:42
it it was kind of like going in that direction So like we were like okay you know what we need to make up like we
16:48
need to start either trying to help Italy in their defense against uh and
16:54
and get Italy and France to like align together against England or we have to
16:59
like go with well or we have to go against England like ourselves But then
17:04
we were like okay the way that we can go against England is to team up with Ove and like get his support in order to try
17:12
to knock the English down a little bit which is kind of what we tried to do
17:17
So I mean I just had an interview with Italy and it seems like you were very
17:24
very adamant about negotiating a peace between France and Italy Unfortunately this does not look
17:32
too peaceful here Um why do you think that this uh this this negotiation this
17:38
peace talk these peace talks failed we've heard mixed things We've heard
17:43
slander from both sides We've heard Max say to us that they betrayed them We've heard Sean say to us
17:49
that Italy betrayed them We don't really know honestly We can't seem to get an unbiased view And I think the chance of
17:56
those two compromising with each other is getting slimmer and slimmer which is
18:01
highly unfortunate but we're going to keep trying because if it doesn't happen that means that England's going to win
18:07
the game Um yeah I think we just need to strengthen our
18:14
communication with both of them and strengthen their communication between each other It would I think benefit us
18:20
to have a discussion when there's not the high stakes of like oh you we have 10 minutes to submit orders Maybe like
18:27
at night we should organize a call and just the three the three countries just sit down and talk for like half an hour
18:32
That might be what's necessary Start twiddling your thumbs Yeah
18:39
So okay So we are going on to this legendary turn where you place your
18:46
faith in Russia and it surprisingly works So I don't think we need to
18:52
explain the like the mentality here of like oh we need to get England out of
18:57
here But I mean were you worried at all that Russia
19:04
wasn't going to follow through on his word i was a little worried I was like in my
19:09
in the back of my head I was like you know what there's a chance that once again he's going to team up with England against us You know it's he's done it
19:16
once before But honestly like like we've said before it was kind of like a situation
19:22
where we're like you know what like we kind of have to take a risk here If we want to if we want to like gain a little
19:28
bit you have to take risks to get the benefit of it of the whatever you're
19:34
trying to do So we were like you know what let's trust him this round And this is like the round to see that if if he's
19:39
actually gonna keep his word And so we're like let's go for it And his plan seemed very fleshed out It seemed very
19:46
like dependent on certain things So I was like you know if he's lying about this he's a great liar cuz it was very
19:52
detailed and I was like "Okay I hope I hope this is true and I hope it's going to work." And it ended up working Mhm
19:59
Yeah Agree So for now Russia has been working with
20:05
you Do you think this means that there's a pretty solid chance that he will
20:10
continue to work with you guys into the foreseeable future or are you worried that this is a temporary thing i think
20:17
it's going to be a a geographic based thing I can see a world where we are
20:24
fighting each other in the south but working heavily together in the north because it really just comes down to
20:30
what we prioritize We both want to get territories in the south and it benefits both of us to
20:38
um push back England in the north So yeah I think there's going to be sort of like a hybrid situation which it's it's
20:46
kind of always been you know we've always been like on and off allies with them Um I see that
20:54
happening The cycle continues The currency cycle of life So I actually
21:02
want to talk about something here You say that England's the biggest threat but now that you and Russia have worked
21:09
together Russia is the player with 10 centers and England has eight At what
21:15
point let me rephrase this Do you think that Russia gets more out of this push against England than you guys do
21:22
uh well seeing as they do have 10 centers and I was about they are pretty
21:28
much kind of gaining more than we are to to put it bluntly But I think that if we
21:35
can mutually all work together US Russia France and Italy to try to smother the
21:41
English out once and for all it'll be an easier game for all of us And I don't know why but I I was saying this earlier
21:48
for some reason I don't know what it is but it just in my mind it feels like we
21:54
could beat Ove but it would I feel like it it if it was a 1 v one If it was a one v one but I feel like it would be
22:00
very difficult to beat Jessica and like and Amber and like England I don't know why It's just like maybe it's cuz just
22:06
we know how cunning she is now and like she's very like unassuming I I don't know I think that smothering England out
22:13
right now is my biggest concern And like it is it is concerning that Russia's very big but I think they're willing to
22:20
give us some um lenience and like help us in in taking England down How are you
22:29
going to successfully fight fight Russia in a 1v one when you when there's such a
22:35
large center disparity between the two of you uh we're going to close that gap
22:40
hopefully That's the intent Um I have I struggle seeing how you're going to do
22:45
that You struggle to understand a lot of our big brain plays Kenan Okay All right
22:54
Your your feeble mind fails to comprehend just like realistically
22:59
where are you getting where are you where are you getting the the four extra centers you need in order to keep pace
23:05
with Russia and also like who's to say that they won't grow even more like what
23:11
if by the time that you get 10 they have 15 like um yeah Yeah of course We are
23:17
counting and praying I'm not sure how it's going seeing the current state of the board but we are praying that
23:23
England will keep pressuring them in the north are right now I think the two
23:28
territories we're looking at for expansion are the South Turkish
23:35
territories and the I mean it's it's it's a really hard
23:42
decision but Venice Rome and Naples are quite enticing
23:49
Mhm And would be quite easy to acquire Oh Oh no It's going to hurt It's going
23:55
to hurt last interview Last interview I remember what we talked about was this long lasting friendship and trust and
24:04
um kind of deceiving others in secret with it in concert with Italy We really
24:12
we wish it didn't have to come down to this but we tried Sadly it's what we're thinking of now I think the problem
24:18
right now is that facade has kind of faded you know like they all kind of are
24:24
aware and um you know I think that because they are looking a little bit
24:29
weak right now the the only viable option for us in order to survive longer
24:35
is to try to form new friendships and like we're not saying that we're going
24:41
to like outright backstab them at this moment but I think that when or I hope
24:47
Italy realizes later as they weaken it which I think they will eventually
24:52
simmer down simmer out a little bit which I'm sorry if you're watching this Italy but you know you're not looking
24:58
too hot So once they kind of simmer out I hope they realize hey you know what you guys have a fighting shot We'll you
25:05
know we're willing to help you guys over the other countries because you've been loyal I find it interesting that you see
25:12
more value in attacking Italy than perhaps slowing down the competitor of Russia by taking a couple of their
25:18
centers instead We But that's the thing It's like we like we said you know we
25:24
lost the fleet in Greece Hopefully taking back Mun we can build a fleet in Trey and move that down but that's going
25:30
to take at least a few rounds And even then I mean a smart I'm sure I'm sure
25:36
he's going to see it coming um and potentially start building defenses down there So it's just like if if there's a
25:45
way to do it without backstabbing our our dear friends we would love to but that may be too difficult or impossible
25:52
Well the other possibility is returning to England and asking them to check
25:58
Russia if they get too big Do you think that I mean obviously it's in England's
26:03
interest now I mean right after right after Jessica saw what we did and backstabbed them and ke she was like "Oh
26:10
does this help you?" And she showed us the Russian 10 versus their eight And she has a point you know we also don't
26:16
like that Russia has 10 but um yeah I don't know It they do have a
26:24
point that like it's a little bit geographically difficult to attack Russia up there now because they're in
26:29
the north coast But I hope they find a way and I hope they don't stop fighting that fight or
26:36
at the very least if they're going to weaken Russia do it in take back K I don't know I just I think it's very
26:42
curious cuz there's a lot to gain from Russia's fall for you It's a more beneficial deal than you attacking
26:49
England which you're you're barely going to get anything from there I would think So is it really it's really just your
26:57
distrust of Jessica that has led you to take this path solely that no you have a
27:02
point You have a point Yeah No honestly I think that I think that maybe after we
27:09
we kind of get get we can suck all we can um leech off of Russia um as much as
27:15
we can then we can turn to England and be like "Hey I think this is the time to
27:22
you know kind of weaken them." And I think that you know maybe our maybe our our worries about England are overblown
27:28
and we should kind of you know look at Russia as more of a threat to us which I
27:34
think they are They definitely are They're like surrounding us on every side almost So I think that Yeah I think
27:41
you're right about that We should turn to England at some point or the other Yeah maybe I mean I think now we've
27:48
gotten to the point where Russia thinks he owns us Um and like Jessica said she doesn't
27:55
make long-term alliances So if she's open to it
28:00
um we obviously are going to take back next round I would like to
28:07
sorry whatever we can do to support England in stopping Russia I would like that If we can get that to like loosen
28:13
territories and then they disband con woo that would be fantastic
28:21
Okay Well here sorry Go ahead Ernest What what it seems to me that you want
28:27
is you simultaneously want Russia to be attacked on all sides but you also don't
28:33
want to get your feet muddled in betraying your now only ally on the board Is that true
28:40
I mean it's kind of true Like we we do want them to be weak but we also want them to help us when it when it'll help
28:46
us Like I think that's the ideal situation is like they're they they get a little weaker so they're not they're
28:52
not gaining like a center every single time while we don't gain anything cuz that would just be like not that's
28:58
suicide Yeah that's not smart for us at all So I think it's definitely ideal for
29:04
us to either get to their level or for them to not gain any more centers um
29:10
until we can kind of catch up to them or we start you know kind of knocking them
29:16
down a little bit um instead of getting their support So I think you're kind of correct in that because we do want their
29:23
help like like we just did with Britain um against Britain But yeah do you do
29:31
you think that maybe you have burned your bridge with the English players like you are going to enter into a
29:38
similar relationship that France and Italy have with England no
29:44
No Because um I think the France and England thing is like or sorry the France and Italy thing is
29:52
like I don't know I think it's those two people in particular are slightly more stubborn I think Jessica is more shrewd
30:00
as to not be so um you know I think I feel like she's the one who like if she sees an
30:07
advantageous alliance between us she'll take it regardless of past experiences
30:13
and obviously we're willing to do the same So I think we can argue with her and make the point of like okay you guys
30:18
backstabbed us once we backstabbed you once Now we're even Let's just call it a clean slate and we have this common
30:25
enemy Let's go after them because it is quite true that Russia poses us poses a
30:31
greater threat Honestly we this is the thing We reached out to England a while ago basically
30:40
begging them to ally with us in Italy and take down Russia And it was Amber who was so anti that She's like "I don't
30:45
know Gabriel Why would we do that we don't make alliances." And look where that look look what that got them So we're going
30:51
to I think try to bring that up again and be like "All right this is what happens when you don't make alliances
30:58
How about an alliance?" You know all right A word of word of advice If
31:04
you do do that you should probably come at it from an apologetic standpoint because I don't think Amber would accept
31:09
anything else except Gabe growling at his knees Amber no But we all know I'm sorry Amber
31:16
if you're watching this but we all know Jessica's calling the shots here
31:21
Amber's just the scary figure head low key
31:27
Yeah So Ernest do you have any questions for our friends here
31:33
well I think everything's been covered other than strategic
31:38
considerations Um let's see here
31:44
So one thing that I see is that you are completely land based now You have no
31:51
fleets You have no way of um mitigating the
31:56
Mediterranean Do you think that's a potential weakness for you yeah I definitely think that it it it is a
32:03
weakness So I think that we will try to build a fleet in Greece again try to rebuild our um naval presence because um
32:11
as we can see Russia and uh you know all the other countries basically have
32:17
fleets except for us So I think that that is definitely weak a weakness but it's also it's you it's kind of an
32:24
advantage in a way because people are not really threatened by us um in the naval areas So they they're kind of like
32:31
fighting their own fight in the sea and then we kind of have a very large um
32:37
like concentration on land So that could help us in a way like try to concentrate
32:42
our forces and um attack one place in inland um or like go after places inland
32:50
without having to worry about like not having um like not being able to attack
32:55
with a fleet on land or anything like that cuz a couple of other countries have been like "Oh yeah we're we're not
33:00
we can't do that because our fleet obviously can't go on land or whatever." And I feel like we haven't had that issue so far But I definitely think that
33:07
you've you've had that issue in reverse Like I'm sorry but my army can't swim in water Yeah I think we should definitely
33:14
build up that naval presence again Do you guys like Sorry Go ahead Sorry I
33:22
mean unless you try to turn that into a strength right oh I'm meek little
33:28
Austria I have no fleets Don't I'll be your forever ally Maybe maybe that's an
33:34
avenue you're willing to explore What What are your thoughts on Wait so that mean with with Russia well
33:42
with anyone in negotiating what when do you think this is more general when do
33:47
you think negotiating from positions of weakness actually benefit you
33:54
um I don't think it does very much because it just shows it's it tells the person that we're negotiating like
34:01
here's someone I can take advantage of and then backstab and they won't be able to fight back
34:08
So I don't I'm not a fan of that bargaining strategy
34:15
Yeah I mean I think that Yeah looking weak in this game Like I lowkey was
34:21
thinking about the Hunger Games and I was thinking about how um in Catching Fire there's this character named Joanna
34:28
Mason and she in her in her hunger games um she won by pretending that she was
34:34
like hella weak and she like didn't make any alliances She would just like she was like about to die like in the first
34:42
minute of the game but then she ended up being like super ruthless and she like killed everybody and then won So like
34:48
that that was like I was very kind of that was very appealing to me because I liked like that underdog story and like
34:54
rising from the ashes But I think that in this game it's not the Hunger Games
34:59
This is the I don't know This is the the the eating games Like we have to be
35:04
eating all the time you know like you can't go around starving
35:12
You have to eat somewhere You know what I mean like you have to either get a territory or you have to support someone
35:18
into somewhere or you have to you know you can't starve in this game or you're going to die So I think that strategy is
35:24
not the best for diplomacy So do you guys have any questions for us
35:33
um what is what has been your guys favorite part of organizing the game what' you say
35:40
what has been your favorite part of organizing the game i think it's interviewing all of you guys Interviewing is cool but personally I I
35:49
just like how dynamic this game has been I already kind of told Seline that a lot
35:55
of diplomacy games this is not really the case This isn't and I think this is I think this is mostly because in any
36:04
good online diplomacy game like people often don't like value their lives as
36:11
much They don't value the win they don't try as hard and thus when they start to lose they just start giving up and start
36:17
trying and that allows for very simplistic alliance structures like oh
36:22
England and France are allied and they're going to take over the entire board and nothing's going to change because no one wants to no one wants to
36:28
like like seek their own self-interest but here everyone is a selfish ba selfish bastard sorry for my like
36:35
wording but I think that that leads to a much more interesting and dynamic game
36:40
like I I mean you've you've been in the you've been in the east which has been interesting but personally I'm I'm more
36:48
I'm like super interested in what's going on in the West cuz like we got Germany supporting France The first turn
36:55
England's mad and then the next turn we got Germany supported by England
37:01
and France is mad And then the next turn we got England being supported by France
37:07
and Germany is mad Like that's that's that's like That is just h that's just
37:14
perfect man That's just it's so funny It's so good And like we obviously we've
37:19
had a very similar situation recently up here in Germany which I just love man
37:25
This is this is the pinnacle of diplomacy The yelling the screaming the absolute chaos that comes and just Oh
37:34
it's so good I love it I'm kind of sad that I had to miss both days because of physics
37:40
It's been a a fun past few days but I don't see it getting any more boring Mhm
37:46
All right Yeah Any more questions for us or will that be it for today
37:54
oh yeah Go ahead I'm wondering like I don't know if you're allowed to say this or not but if you guys were playing what
38:02
would your strategy be and like what country do you think that you would want to start with and how would that I don't
38:08
know what would your Well I I guess I'll answer first Um I know like we we you have re you can
38:16
look back with 2020 vision so it's very hard but let's say let's put myself at
38:21
the start of the game and let's say I'm Turkey because Turkey has died whatever
38:26
I think that like knowing my relationship with
38:32
Ave I think ne I think it would be hard to negotiate with him harder than it
38:39
would be negotiate with Austria which is you in this case And then for my last consideration for Turkey I think that
38:46
sorry Italy I think that they would be it would be hard for me to read them personally cuz I I think
38:53
that they're they would be more crafty given that what I saw in this game What
38:59
are your thoughts here so I'm going to approach this question
39:05
in a much more general sense because I mean once you've played enough diplomacy
39:11
games like you start looking into the strategy of it all like there's several common openings for all the all the
39:18
countries and stuff and some people I think they make the mistake of judging
39:23
one opening as better than all the rest when really strategy only gets you so far It's the diplomacy aspect that
39:30
matters much that matters much more And you know basically the goal for me is to
39:39
find an early ally And I mean I'll I'll
39:44
just be honest even though I really don't want to be in case we play future diplomacy games and I'm in them but
39:51
like I I do pull an Ove I do talk to both both sides and earnest like and I I
39:59
propose alliances with both sides but like personally I think you're really stupid if you don't do that Cuz like
40:06
I've had a couple of situations where like I I'm talking to one country and
40:11
they literally say "Yeah sorry I'm not interested in alliance with you I'm interested in alliance with France instead of you England." I'm like "Okay
40:18
Germany." Like you're just sealing your fate You're making me want to attack you I don't understand what the goal behind
40:24
that is And at least Yeah I think I think we learned that these past few rounds when we gained success from
40:30
outlying with Russia I believe that now Like I I I know that if you play with
40:36
the same people like you could be inclined to distrust somebody because of their reputation but
40:43
honestly I tend not to look at it that way because if you look at the present
40:48
you could more accurately judge what someone's going to do based on the reward that they get And so when I when
40:55
I'm starting out I I talk to both sides I try and find which deal is better for me I work in my self-interest and I
41:02
execute what I think is best for me And for the country that I would want
41:08
to start out as I'd like to start out as Russia because not not because not
41:15
because don't we all no I like to start off as Russia just because of how much of a presence they have I mean like
41:22
while other countries like Turkey really only need to talk to three people Italy Austria and Russia Russia is basically
41:30
required to talk to everybody else They need to talk I think this to to these
41:35
guys like if you pick any country right i think it was in our last Yeah But you need to talk to Turkey as Russia you
41:42
need to talk to Austria Germany England France is important and Italy is important too It's a very diplomatic
41:48
heavy game and I think a good Russian player I think they're pretty they're
41:53
they're good if they're a good Russian player Yeah I'm glad you brought that up
41:59
because I think the um what we learned last round is the the power of diplomacy
42:04
in this game you know when we were seemingly strategically screwed Basically through
42:12
some heavy heavy planning with Ove and others we were able to coordinate an
42:18
attack that actually won us back some ground So I definitely believe that
42:23
strategy only gets you so far It's all about playing the people
42:31
Will that be all for today folks i think I think so I think so Thank you
42:37
guys so much I really appreciate this This was Oh man I feel like these interviews just keep getting better and
42:43
better cuz like back to back backtoback like 15 minute calls I think Um it was
42:49
really fun listening to all you guys I I know I generally don't talk much Maybe
42:54
that'll change but I just like listening and talking in when I feel like it because I think that
43:00
um I feel like Kenan's more experienced but I also think that it's worth listening even if I'm not um adding much
43:10
But one final food for thought I guess
43:16
to I guess to leave you with something to go to go to sleep like smiling about
43:22
I think that this hosting this like sort of hybrid in person but also over a
43:28
couple of days sort of diplomacy over the school year um really adds an
43:34
interesting dynamic to the game that online diplomacy or inerson diplomacy with 15 minutes cannot have
43:41
Yeah I think this is really fun Yeah and fun and
43:48
um I guess just really interesting to watch as an detached observer
43:55
Yeah Well thank you guys for organizing in such a dynamic fun way Mhm Yep I
44:02
can't wait to see what the future holds Good luck on your AP Spanish stuff or whatever Thank you guys
44:12
Sorry about that Wake up I missed it Unlike me After that we're done pretty
44:17
much Wait Audrey's going to be taking psych in the afternoon though right so you're going to be missing a key rush Oh
44:23

44:29
letting me know Uh see you guys man See you Bye Hi but
