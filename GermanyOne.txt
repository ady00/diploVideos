0:00
if you guys are ready why don't we start so like it's basically it's almost going
0:07
to be like hot seat right and i know it's like your first game coming into this game as germany i mean and what
0:16
were your initial plans even though it was your first game like or initial strategy overall what were you
0:22
approaching this game with as like a philosophy
0:27
um well to be honest it was just kind of like i think like the problem with this
0:33
game for us or at least for me and i think this is probably true for hini too is that we're both very like not good
0:39
liars or like good schemers and so i mean i think it was
0:45
just kind of like it was just like kind of weird for me cuz like everyone is trying to make out like make like allies
0:52
and stuff and like negotiate but it's like you're going like everyone's going to backstab each other within like three rounds so then it's just kind of like
0:58
how do you like effectively do anything i guess i don't know yeah well i think
1:04
at the beginning russia told us that turkey russia and austria were all going to
1:10
like fight it out so i guess we were like we might as well just go west
1:15
yeah so we tried to take england but then we didn't really i don't know if we really thought it out enough
1:21
and we tried to work with france to take england [Music] but then france like didn't really help
1:27
us at all and so now the plan has changed you have flip-flopped
1:32
yeah i mean we have to take out france or england or both eventually so do you
1:38
think that are do you really think that it's necessary to lie in this game in order to succeed or could you play an
1:44
honest game and still manage to take the win for as long i mean like you could
1:50
still make deals and as long as people honor their word you should be fine
1:56
yeah i think one i think that's what other i think i don't think a lot of
2:01
people who are lying right now wait no a lot of people everyone has lied so far
2:06
other than like russia hasn't lied i think other than russia i
2:12
guess and then maybe france has france lied i don't really
2:18
know i don't know what their relations are with the other countries to be honest
2:25
so what about have you guys thought about long-term like strategically how
2:31
would you manage to get the win if you are you know trying not to be deceitful
2:37
people but also trying to make your way in the world well we've kind of given up on being deceitful cuz we like we kind
2:44
of lied to both france and russia last turn but
2:49
um i don't know we're kind of debating what our strategy is going to be now because we're kind of like stuck at the
2:55
moment well it seems like i i would argue that your board state sort of reflects this
3:02
with like pockets of armies spread across all over like some to the left i
3:08
mean some to the west some to the east some to the north and it doesn't seem
3:13
like you have a really generally defined direction but if you could to choose where do you think that you would focus
3:20
more on the north side west side back into russia where would you go
3:26
i think the well right now i think the
3:31
north because russia is threatening us the most right now i think
3:38
yeah i would say north maybe like i don't know yeah probably north so
3:45
just because there's so many territories there that can like immediately take our um what's it called
3:52
home bases so do you have a solidified plan between
3:57
england and france like which one is your enemy which one is your ally because it seems like you're still
4:03
flip-flopping and will you continue to sort of sort of like be in the flow
4:09
state between those two or are you going to choose an ally and are you going to choose your enemy at what point do you
4:16
think you'll do that if you haven't done that now i feel like now like we've kind of like it's kind of too late to ally with
4:22
france again like i would be surprised if they trusted us and like they're threatening us now to take
4:29
munich so who knows they also might just be saying
4:36
that as like a distraction while they go and take um belgium or yeah
4:44
belgium i don't know i just would be surprised if like we tried to strike an agreement with them
4:50
and they like said yes or like actually did it we might have to ally with england at this
4:56
point why would that be a surprise to you huh why would ally why would the ally
5:04
request being accepted be a surprise to you because we backstabbed them
5:09
like this turn yeah they sounded pretty upset when they found out
5:17
but okay in our defense they were getting way too much territory and i
5:23
politely asked if we could have belgium and they said no yeah i mean their choice yeah it was like a difficult
5:30
position because like no matter what we did we'd have to like um betray someone
5:36
like and that's exactly and that's what the game is so it's like it's like we had to take a risk and like maybe we took a
5:42
slightly too big risk this time but it's better than just like hiding in that corner cuz otherwise we would have just
5:48
been stuck for the whole time well talking about hiding in corners which country do you think is
5:56
doing more secretive stuff is expanding slowly yet no one recognizes their power
6:03
who do you think is being by i don't know probably like austria
6:12
yeah u maybe austria i don't know they're kind of just like i think right now they're just playing defense i can't tell i think turkey actually is like the
6:21
cuz like turkey backstabbed russia this turn and like they're actually getting a good amount of territory in like the
6:28
southeast area so i think they're slightly like you
6:33
know underestimated maybe okay that is one
6:39
way of looking at it but to take a different angle i assume that you you i
6:46
assume that you you attacked france out of like fear because they're getting too big they're getting too powerful and
6:53
thus you started attacking them but why is it so hard for you to make
7:00
amends why do you think the mere necessity of trying to check their power
7:05
is justification that you should never work again because wouldn't it it could because it
7:12
could turn out to your benefit to start working for them again and if that were to happen why couldn't bridges be
7:19
rebuilt why couldn't the burn bridges be rebuilt is it's something that could happen right is it not
7:25
well i honestly i'm good to rebuild them because i think the because we supported
7:31
them into belgium last the turn before this turn i forgot what like season and
7:38
year that was but i feel like i don't
7:43
know if they would accept though because i think they're probably still caught up
7:48
over this turn like us backstabbing them well at this point it seems like sorry
7:54
go ahead i also think it's just like it's not even just like oh like they won't trust us but it's just like i
8:00
think if we keep on going back and forth between who we're allied with like right now like first we were allied with
8:06
france and russia and now we're allied with italy and england and then if we go back and then we betray italy and
8:12
england and then go back to ally with france and russia like i feel like that
8:18
isn't like the best strategy long term either
8:24
okay yes this is this is true um
8:29
but it could okay never mind i mean i i was i was going to continue on that point but i don't i don't see any need
8:35
to do that do you think that out of the chaos that is being produced by these
8:41
wars against france and these wars against russia that there will be a predominant power that arises out of the
8:48
conflict and which power would become the dominant one in that scenario well
8:54
ideally us right or between france and russia only well france and russia they
9:00
were the most powerful they are falling now and but who would have like the
9:05
largest board presence who would be like the biggest threat to take out next like the next the next person that you want
9:13
to target the next person you got to get out well i think russia is kind of like
9:18
damaged from this turn like i don't really know how they're going to recover unless people decide to like help them
9:23
but i don't think anyone will because everyone obviously wants a country to be out yeah i feel like we
9:31
need to focus on getting france and russia out even if they're becoming
9:36
weaker this turn because if we just leave them alone they'll like get come back up yeah
9:42
but once they're gone once they are no longer a factor what's the plan from
9:47
there what's going to happen next
9:53
well i guess doesn't that depend on like how they get out so like who replaces them i guess is
10:02
what that depends on yeah i think whatever power replace like
10:08
takes the most of their supply centers and stuff that's when we go for next
10:15
yeah it also kind of just depends on how we end up moving because we're kind of split between like our different options
10:21
right now so well what are those different options and uh what are the
10:26
pros and cons well it's basically it's basically ally with
10:32
russia or continue working against russia because they offered a
10:39
um an allyship where we retreat from where were we in uh prussia and sisia
10:47
sisia and then um they go into skag is that what it is
10:54
ocean yeah and then um later on they support us into the north sea but also
11:01
because they want us to obviously stay away from warsaw but what we also could easily do is just make them really
11:09
really believe we're going to do that than them trying to go then have them go into scagg and us attack russia anyways
11:15
bro what happened to not being deceitful to me well it's all suddenly became a
11:21
master liar in like 3 seconds like what other choice do we have
11:26
though because like i don't know like russia like we could like do what they're
11:34
saying but honestly we still don't gain much for a while and like there's a lot of risks that accompany that cuz even if
11:39
they say they'll support us into the uh north sea by then england's going to have like two or three more fleets
11:46
possibly so like it won't be easy to get in there versus we could start just picking
11:53
at russia and then we could start taking a lot of the east so you mentioned uh how right now at
12:01
this moment you are currently allied with england and italy which one do you
12:06
think is the better ally longterm short term or in general
12:13
i think italy long term because because italy is not actually threatening us
12:19
right now but england yeah i agree i think long term like in an ideal
12:25
scenario like the final if it had to be like oh there like two final nations it would be like us in the north and italy
12:31
in the south or something i think because that's realistic realistically where it's going
12:38
they're trying to get like into like the mediterranean area and get like france's territory but we're going the opposite
12:44
direction so i think like like we're gonna end up even if we don't fight with england now we're going
12:50
to have to soon now that they're in like norway and sweden so it comes down to
12:56
playing all sides a game of thrones am i right a game of thrones
13:03
so do you think that you'll have any problems with the likes of austria in
13:09
this whole debacle i don't know they've been really quiet and in terms of like at least us and
13:17
like i don't know like i kind of like they're a little scary so i don't really
13:23
know what to expect from them but now that like they're a little bit safer because um i think it seems like turkey
13:30
allied with them um they might end up coming for us which would be a little dangerous since they are the closest or
13:37
well they're one of the closest so mhm but i don't know we haven't really thought much of that
13:44
all right well i guess you should start thinking about that
13:49
i mean maybe if we could like ally with turkey that would be good and then have
13:54
turkey like i don't know get rid of aia for us and how well we get rid of russia but i
14:01
don't know if that would really work because i think turkey and austria have a pretty tight bond now although i can't
14:08
imagine that lasting for long because turkeyy's eventually going to have to impede on austria's territory
14:17
ernest do you have any questions well it sounds like you think that this turkey
14:23
um alliance breaking with austria is inevitable in some way because of the
14:29
geographic makeup of the board well what do you think is geographically inevitable in other areas on the board
14:47
i mean like i guess like france and italy like battling but they aren't allied at all i mean eventually there is
14:55
a possibility we're going to have to fight with italy too depending on how far north they're going to start coming
15:01
because they do want to get into marseilles so yeah i think either
15:08
um england or france will die out soon
15:14
cuz they're right ne i feel like everyone's those are the people that everyone's coming for and russia i guess
15:21
but yeah agreed well if both france and
15:27
russia are being like completely harmed this round then what powers will there
15:34
be to stop england from attacking you would it it would only be you and would
15:40
that be worse than having friends with french and russian forces
15:47
nice save there ken wait what so you said french after france i was
15:54
just making i was making are you just saying like what if what if england comes for us no but i'm saying with the
16:00
with the declining uh prowess of french and russian forces do you think that
16:06
england will have an easier time getting more centers getting more strength and
16:11
thus being a bigger pain in your behind or do you think like do you think that's
16:18
not a non-issue something you don't need to worry about a pain in your behind you
16:23
i don't think it's as big of an issue because ideally england will also lose a
16:30
lot throughout this but i don't know how would they lose anything when you're
16:35
allied with them and france and russia are basically going to die cuz i think
16:42
this turn we might like obviously want to get rid of
16:47
russia but right now we're kind of cornered cuz russia's in the baltic sea right now so they're kind we kind of
16:54
might have to support them against england in this turn which i don't know i just want to
17:01
let england and russia like fight it out and then fight whoever wins but i don't
17:06
know really i don't really know where this is going h i think i rather like get rid of
17:13
russia and then um fight england ourselves because if we get more into
17:20
russian territory then we can like come up around from
17:26
um and like go basically do the same thing that russia did to get into norway
17:32
or was it sweden whichever one they got into and then maybe attack um england and then we also might build
17:39
a fleet in berlin next round if we're able to and then that we can get to like the baltic sea area
17:46
okay so the plan is to stick with your guns at least for now
17:53
i guess all right erns do you have any questions
18:04
ernest you
18:15
so you mentioned how oh i was muted yeah you were muted do you go ahead and talk
18:22
uh who do you think is the biggest pearl clutcher as in the person who's most culture
18:30
the most defensive or secretive um defensive or
18:37
secretive probably austria they're i don't know what like i feel like i don't
18:42
really know what their plan is but i don't know maybe i just like am not really talking with them as much
18:49
yeah we haven't talked to austria at all other than like right before the first spring they were like "oh let's not attack each other
18:56
okay was that all the questions we asked no hold on hold on i i have a couple more ernest you mentioned i meant the
19:04
um the the default questions that we asked yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah uh you
19:10
mentioned earlier how an an ideal long-term alliance with italy where you take the north they take the south would
19:17
be you know something that you would could look forward to
19:23
however what exactly does that entail do you think that italy will be restricted
19:29
from being down south so far and wish to come up and does that mean that you
19:35
would also be getting too much of a target on your own back are you worried that a
19:43
powerful alliance like that could lead to you becoming the big bad making you the pe person everyone targets like
19:49
russia and french i mean that is inevitable eventually if
19:56
we do want to get any power right like
20:03
but like i mean i think it's more like we have to like be strategic i guess
20:08
about like if we do get that much territory how do we defend like how do we defend that i guess long term and
20:15
i i don't really know how to do that but i think if there's less countries in
20:20
then it'll be easier maybe because i don't know eventually like everyone's going to have to betray
20:26
each other so i don't know how anything could like last like any of these sort
20:33
of allyships or like how anyone will trust the people who like backstab them in earlier rounds
20:42
i don't know like it's kind of hard for i guess it's like hard for us because we actually haven't been like backstabbed at all we just have done it they get the
20:49
ratchet just accidental
20:54
what would you accidental insertion of the knife between the rib cage so i think what ernest was about to say is
21:01
what would you do if you were stabbed would you yes that was what i was going to say would you try and make amends
21:07
with your ally or is it all out war no no returning from this honestly hatchet
21:15
been cast sorry wrong metaphor i would be open to making amends cuz low key
21:20
like i i understand the backstabber's point of view like
21:26
he's too much liberal bro she has too much empathy but yeah also i feel like you can't like
21:33
automatically like hate anyone who backstabs you because at some point everyone in the game is going to
21:39
backstab you i feel like
21:46
i agree we ourselves are backstabbers so it would be hypocritical of us okay um
21:54
well i mean it would only be hypocritical if we expect for people we backstab to still ally with us which i
22:00
don't know i kind of don't expect them to still want to i don't either
22:06
and that's why i'm still scared of russia but i feel like what they're saying to
22:12
us about like i think i feel like what they're saying to us about like because they
22:18
were telling us like oh like no one no one is going to like ally with us anymore like people don't trust us like
22:24
they were saying all of that to us but like i feel like like what if they're saying that to everyone now
22:32
who do you think is the most shallot what a question w question
22:41
uh italy i don't know wait what he said
22:46
"who's the most chalant?" wait low key us i mean no not us most nonchalant
22:52
you're like self-glazing um oh most chalant russia
22:58
yeah really russia's like very shalant do you think it's it's the person that's
23:04
it's the people that are commanding russia that makes it chalant or just
23:09
it's definitely one of them one of them i i think i think we all
23:16
know which one like the other two are actually like
23:22
very shalant but i don't really know like if they're hiding something that i mean very nonchalant because like like
23:28
samir and mji like haven't really said anything like i don't i don't know if they're like the masterminds or if they're just kind of like just chilling
23:35
and i feel like it might just be the second one have you guys all talked to everyone on every team yet uh we barely
23:44
talked to austria like literally all we said was in a little today but we just
23:50
said that we don't like russia that's all and what about turkey
23:56
uh we kind of like they just told us not to trust russia yeah i think the consensus that most
24:03
people just don't really like russia yeah but like i don't really know i
24:09
actually kind of don't know where that came from to be honest like that was all before like any other rounds happened
24:15
but i think it's just because audrey is like way too shal i think just the fact that russia was
24:22
forming alliances with everyone made them untrustworthy
24:27
yeah so all right okay well if we're going in that direction what is one tip for the
24:34
russians that you would give to them you have to just break some of your
24:40
alliances and um get like alliances that you're not that you'reed to you just
24:49
can't be friends with everyone basically if you're friends with everyone you're friends with no one mhm
24:56
that's a german mindset yeah guts and tug guccen tug
25:04
you know if you ever die i'm going to get that like hitler getting really mad in a bunker scene and i'm going to like
25:10
it with your faces it's the wrong era though what the heck oh it's it's a funny it's the mad hitler
25:17
scene so it's a meme anyway um do you
25:22
have any question more questions ken ah i'm all out but well let's talk about
25:27
the board game sorry the state of the board what am i saying
25:33
what you you earlier you mentioned something about the nordic states the what is your plan or
25:41
strategy there um the nordic states so denmark norway
25:48
sweden that area i think right now it kind of depends on
25:54
what we do like if we if we do help russia or if we don't help russia yeah we're still deciding on that if we
26:01
should just if we should actually follow through with the plan that russia gave us to help them go back to the nordic
26:07
states or backstab them again
26:14
all right and i guess the same is true for french the french area
26:20
i guess we just have to test how many times we can like backstab people in the house
26:26
karina's going to make a big experiment how deep can i insert this knife before it starts to hurt
26:37
but yeah i think we should i think we should try to repair all of our alliances and then decide if we're going
26:42
to keep them yeah
26:49
okay i am all out of questions are you earnest
26:54
no i mean like i think we covered everything like what is your what do you
27:00
want to present externally versus internally what what what does that
27:05
question mean what do you want to present to the world versus what are your internal thoughts because it seems
27:11
like i mean luckily it doesn't look like many people according to your testimony
27:17
have really you know designated you as the backstabber type of person well
27:23
maybe now they will because we actually have back stuff but i don't know like it's really weird because like i feel
27:30
like people do have like a negative or i don't know do i think
27:35
everyone has like a very neutral opinion on us for the most part other than the people who backs up so it's kind of like
27:42
weird because like and like no one's like directly tried to attack us either i think the only people who don't like
27:47
us are france and russia like i feel like and i feel like people get over the backstabbing relatively quickly cuz the
27:54
turn before this the turn before this last turn we went against england and
28:00
they were like fine with allying with us for this turn well we didn't but we didn't directly actually do anything we
28:05
just like moved kind of near them yeah well we supported france to get
28:11
belgium which is moving near them oh yeah i guess
28:17
well it seems like you guys are very very conflicted on what you want to do
28:25
it's just hard we don't really know who our enemies are yeah like maybe you should start thinking about that you
28:31
know i did oh continue you can you can go ahead first i just i don't really think like
28:38
we have any like real enemies yet like we've only backstabbed each person like one time
28:45
i only stabbed two people nothing to see here yeah we did it's more like i just don't know like who's going to go after
28:51
us like austria and turkey are allied now so what are they going to do
28:58
okay yeah like they it's like i just don't understand the point of that alliance low key cuz they're both right
29:03
next to each other and like turkey needs to go for austria so you know it's funny because like we did have a pre preloaded
29:10
question of like who do you see as your best allies or worst enemies and it seems like you guys are the worst team
29:17
to ask that question cuz it's like i think everyone's our friend and everyone's our ally and enemy at the
29:24
same time schroinger's freaking friend schroinger's schroinger's diplomacy
29:31
board diplomacy board okay but i am
29:36
finished now and personally i think this was very insightful thank you thank you
29:43
very much for answering our questions and me and we're hoping to make this a weekend weekly thing if you guys are
29:50
down for that oh sure so i'm looking forward to next week i'm
29:56
also looking forward to tomorrow so i guess we'll see you then if that's uh if
30:02
we're going to end it off here yeah unless ernest you have any questions just last check in last time all right
30:11
so happy stabbing guys gets to like insert the blade further
30:17
into their chest i don't know okay thanks guys bye goodbye
