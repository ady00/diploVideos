0:00
well it is a very unfortunate position you find yourselves in in diplomacy guys
0:06
I know right pretty much There is that one scenario if you convince somebody to
0:12
walk out one of your home centers You can build please You could you could
0:17
theoretically build a new unit if one of your home centers was unoccupied by the end of the year Well here's an idea
0:23
Here's an just food for thought to keep you in the game convince Britain to I
0:29
will be your loyal vassel I I want to role play as like the the Reich has been
0:35
conquered right
0:40
and then and then and then you also you could do the emotional argument Hey I didn't don't want to be out I still want
0:46
to play like at least one more turn of the film please And then maybe England would never do that for us Second you
0:54
could leverage your friendship with with um with Seline and Austria Ask Austria
1:01
to move Also I don't think we really want to Yeah Join Well this is a case
1:07
study I guess The way why does J not want to continue the game well I mean I
1:14
think the the answer is quite obvious but we'll get there when we get there For now the way we're doing this is a
1:20
little bit different than last time We're going to be um asking you
1:25
questions on a season by season basis instead of like just at the point where
1:30
we are right now like the present So starting off from our last interview this was the next move order right here
1:39
And I think I mean would you consider this set of moves to be
1:45
uh one of the first mistakes or that led to your downfall
1:50
i don't think that well at the time it didn't really seem
1:56
like a mistake like even after it happened I think our like next move was the one that was a mistake These ones
2:02
these ones all look fine to me Do you think Sorry Go ahead I mean yeah I I
2:09
think it was honestly it was the move before this that was the big mistake and then after this I think the problem was
2:16
we trusted Russia in this move Do you regret not going after Warsaw with Sisia
2:21
and Prussia a little bit I mean we probably should have done that if we wanted to stay in
2:27
the game I mean like what I see here is an unnecessary support to for Sweden to
2:34
hold because Russia can't attack Well Russia Russia told us that they were
2:39
going to or I don't know It was complicated Oh I I see I see I see
2:44
there's a Baltic Fleet I'm just blind today Jeez Uh sorry Well anyway um what
2:51
are your thoughts here on France and England working together when previously it was you and England working together
3:01
uh I mean I can't really blame them I guess Well don't talk don't talk about
3:06
it like that Why do you think they did that well I guess England I don't think
3:12
England ever really had like a real alliance with us Like Yeah I agree
3:20
What makes you say that well cuz kind of like we were working with England but it was more like
3:25
England was working with Italy and we were working with Italy and like I don't know England was really flippy floppy I
3:32
guess with their alliances and it just ended up working out in their favor I guess but weren't necessarily actually
3:40
allied with them Mhm We just helped them out one time but like it was very
3:46
like transactional Transactional I see So it was a toxic
3:52
relationship from the start Toxic relationship Tip number one guys don't make your relationship about
3:57
transactions You got to make sure that you have that innocent and pure love Miss Sone talks about all the time
4:05
All right Um what are your thoughts i mean like obviously you trusted Russia
4:11
and you got burned with him moving into Keel What were your feelings when that
4:17
happened was that like just the ultimate betrayal
4:22
yeah just like annoyance Yeah
4:27
I don't know I don't know why we ever trusted Russia in the first place Yeah I think we just really wanted to
4:34
believe in the good of people's hearts but clearly we couldn't have So you guys
4:41
mentioned that I mean I heard some I forget who I'm sorry It's not because I mix up your names guys
4:48
Um basically you one of you guys said that your mistake was the turn before this one or was it the one after because
4:55
before this was when I believe you moved in all directions Was that the mistake
5:02
or am I wrong yeah I think that was the
5:08
mistake cuz it just kind of wasn't a cohesive plan and we thought we could do like everything at once Yeah it wasn't
5:16
good All right We thought that would be safe because
5:22
it's like the middle of all of them but you're clearly wrong Yeah
5:28
All right moving on to the next phase You decide to destroy the army in
5:35
Cisia I guess that's the smart play It's isolated not connected to anything
5:41
Um but at this point what were you guys thinking
5:48
just [ __ ] like nothing good was about to happen Yeah we kind of I think we
5:53
kind of knew it was I think we were still trying to do something I don't know what Yeah I I did try to that um
6:01
day I did try to negotiate with Russia and France but then like England came in and was like "Can I talk to you guys for
6:07
a sec?" And then I kind of knew we were like it was done We were done for
6:12
What are your thoughts on Austria trying to get a piece of the pie with their army in Bohemia
6:18
uh that's like smart I guess Yeah I mean like they kind of like I mean they had
6:24
to go over there at some point and like they power so they obviously couldn't go into the
6:30
Mediterranean so it makes sense that they had to do it eventually But it
6:35
sucked But also like you know we were like we never really talked to them so I
6:40
didn't expect them to like feel any sort of like um what like friendship or something Mhm
6:50
Do you think that with some hindsight that you would be able to maybe turn
6:57
this position around or was this doomed was were their cards rigged from the
7:02
start yeah I think at this point you couldn't we couldn't turn it
7:08
around Like it wasn't just because of our position but also because like every other country was just like plotting on
7:14
us Not going to lie Yeah I think like at this point like they could see
7:20
that we were fragmented and like obviously it makes more sense for them to all just try to get a piece instead of um helping us So like it was kind of
7:29
like even if we tried to work with someone and we like kind of did and
7:34
Russia they again they claimed that they would like slightly help us but like obviously they didn't and yeah and like
7:42
I don't know I think we also just gave up So do you think you'll regret that decision
7:49
of giving up or are you do you think that's completely justified and you're happy with your decision
7:56
i'm happy with it Yeah me too I think even if we didn't give up we would have
8:02
lost in the next one or two turns Anyways
8:07
All right we'll have to wait and see if that opinions opinion holds by the end of the game We shall see What if they
8:13
like prolong your death like Yeah that'd be very funny if they just don't listen to you guys and just leave your center
8:19
open Say Ernest uh what do you think about this move set
8:27
um I see a mistake like a missed opportunity if you
8:34
will Um what you can see here is France and
8:41
England being kind of iffy on each other right you can see the English Channel holds and breast also holds I think it
8:49
was a missed opportunity here to go against England with France
8:57
Um are you suggesting Ernest that maybe there was some tension between them that maybe the Germany players could have
9:05
perhaps sewed the seeds of discord and made it up with their lives
9:11
well I think that if you look at Keev like if you
9:16
look at the middle the heartland of Germany you can see that it's very hard to get back that center but also keep
9:23
Russia from getting adjacent province is as well in Bavaria So or I think it's
9:32
Berlin Berlin Bavaria is in Kiev Anyway
9:37
um the so like what I would do if I were in your shoes was try to twist France to to
9:45
your side and
9:54
um it's just just holding right like a lot of units are holding What you'll see
10:00
in the next coming days is that even with attacks like even with movements that go nowhere they can still you can
10:07
still gain value out of a troop cuz when you hold you get basically zero value out of that troop just stays
10:15
there and I think that you would have been much better if you tried to move
10:22
Munich Damn he's powerful So
10:28
here do you talk so Ernest talks about missed opportunities Do you guys just
10:35
from quickly glancing here see anything that you could have done that maybe could have been your lucky streak if you
10:42
just ordered a bit differently um no not
10:50
really Tommy did you see anything [Music]
11:01
um I don't think there's anything we really could have done that would have made any like dramatic difference
11:10
Well I mean maybe we could have I I don't know We could have just
11:18
moved the army in RA into Munich and the army in Munich into Berlin and then the next turn we could have held Munich I
11:26
mean we already we still are Wait are we still holding Munich i have no idea honestly I think
11:32
like I think like there's like other things we could have done but nothing that would have been like of substance
11:41
I see Well I guess it is I guess it is all
11:47
pointless Like very nihilistic take you guys in a very unfortunate way to see
11:52
new players go And I'm very sorry to feel that way Let's move on to the next season
11:59
where you managed to successfully hold Ke at the loss of three of your other
12:05
centers I I guess the most the most interesting
12:10
thing that happened in this phase was Austria holding all units I mean do you have any like substantive commentary to
12:16
provide on that idea i don't know why they did that
12:22
I think uh they probably were just trying to see what would happen realistically I mean I'm surprised they
12:29
didn't try to take Munan cuz they definitely could have but um maybe they were just afraid of like the other
12:37
like the other countries around there I don't know why Yeah cuz no one threatening them Yeah I
12:45
don't know why they didn't take Munich Yeah And they didn't like But they seem to be doing well so I
12:52
guess maybe they had a reason Who do you think is benefiting more off of your
12:57
demise um definitely England England and Russia
13:03
I don't know who which one is more though Yeah
13:09
I think like Yeah I think um Austria like well
13:16
is holding Munich I actually think that they're benefiting the most because them getting
13:21
across Germany and getting into West um Western Europe is probably the most beneficial for them because that makes
13:29
it easier for them to now like I don't know I think it probably would have been harder if they just tried to go north
13:36
Um but yeah I don't know England seems to like be benefiting a lot I don't think Russia's going to last though
13:42
after this really I don't know Like I mean they don't seem
13:49
to be making very or actually I don't know I can't
13:54
tell Same All right I guess we shall move on
14:02
actually Um so what are your thoughts on Italy
14:07
are you happy with how they're doing with France in this phase right here successfully taking Spain
14:15
um I guess well I don't really have any problems with Italy or France Like it
14:21
was most just England and Russia that were like pissing us off I think I
14:27
personally I think like I support Italy cuz out of they never like were able to directly help us and sometimes I kind of
14:34
regret that cuz they did have a plan um for us to kind of take out France but we
14:39
kind of didn't listen cuz we thought we could instead take um Russia and that kind of led to us getting out But I
14:46
think I'm rooting for Italy personally but I'm rooting against
14:52
France and I mean not France Russia and England Mhm I see All right Ernest do
14:58
you have anything to add
15:05
um what are your thoughts on France betraying England this turn
15:12
do you referencing rur moving into Belgium yes I feel like they Wait did
15:18
they not agree on that no I don't think so
15:24
I think realistically that was part of their plan the whole time There's no way they planned on letting England hold it that whole time cuz the reason why they
15:31
were so like antagonistic towards us and like the fact that they let
15:36
England take Belgium seemed like odd if they weren't planning to take it back later
15:44
and like you know France wasn't doing so well I think at a certain point So
15:50
what you're making it sound is more of a arrangement than a betrayal Is that
15:56
correct no I think maybe the English it was I think it probably was a betrayal
16:02
but France was planning that betrayal All right that's an interesting take
16:08
Moving on to the next phase Well lucky you You have two units left and
16:14
thankfully they're in the two centers that you own So hey I mean that's you take it Take the wins or you can still
16:19
get them And obviously you destroyed the fleet in Helgoland Um do you think that
16:25
was the right choice yes I think I don't know Yeah
16:34
I mean I'm not looking for much more because I agree Like what the hell else are we going to do with hell
16:41
well actually like hell is I think hell would be the
16:47
um more you would have more options in hell
16:54
Okay because again thinking of the bounces right um you have Denmark and Holland which
17:01
are Oh my god my PC is about to die
17:06
Um if you you could play like a guessing game
17:12
You could say um if you left Kio open
17:18
Mhm Russia if Russia tried to move in you could support from hell into
17:27
Berlin If if um England tried to support into K
17:33
with the same force it would bounce and you would hold key from hell
17:39
Um but the the main part about having h how is just I mean it's the only
17:46
difference is that you're not adjacent to mud anymore but you look weaker while basically having the same defensive
17:52
opportunities as Q Well this is the year where Germany's go
17:59
to die Unfortunately you decided not to submit any orders and you decided to not submit
18:06
any orders for the retreats meaning both of your units got disbanded Now you have told me before that this is something
18:13
that you do not currently regret Do you ever think you will regret it
18:22
no not really Well I'm glad that you have the conviction to stick by your
18:28
actions And as I I think as I did say before
18:34
theoretically either England or Austria can vacate one of these two centers and
18:39
you'd technically still be in the game because you can build a new unit in that center Mhm
18:47
So what do you think what do you think you would do if that were to happen
18:54
i don't think we would build anything still but I don't know about Ton B Yeah
19:00
I don't think we'd do anything like Yeah I think traditional
19:08
surrender Yeah I mean like we we chose not to like
19:13
give orders and like disband our units So it's like it was an act of protest
19:18
against the brutality of this game An act of protest Wait what's it called
19:24
civil disobedience baby Yeah Well it's not self cuz you're not breaking any rules Well I guess I guess so This is
19:34
like self emulation It's not even self emulation cuz you can't It's illegal to burn yourself Hey whatever
19:42
The So this is where we are currently This is the present state of the game right now It's not looking good for you
19:49
You are likely not going to be able to play another turn even if you wish to
19:56
So now that you are here would you do this again or has this
20:04
experience scarred you we're not playing Pandemic Legacy Like will we play again yes
20:13
I um probably would but maybe not
20:23
like in like this format I guess like where it spans like multiple days and
20:30
weeks Like I would just want to get it over within like a day Interesting
20:36
Yeah I think I also I just think I'm kind of like I'm not suited for these types of games Like I think I just like
20:43
I just Huh What's your What's your personality wait Kenan just on an off note I would
20:51
like to survey the diplomacy players and ask for their personality types
20:58
I guess that's also cool And you guys what the way you feel it's perfectly fine if you don't want to play this game
21:04
again or if you want to play it in a different way or if you would you be open to playing it playing it across a
21:10
few accesses as in we just when Mish McBride says board game day would you be
21:16
open to play it again i think everyone has had their diplomacy fixed by now But if everyone's up for it yeah I'm totally
21:22
down to do that too I mean yeah maybe I mean we only have
21:29
two more like access weeks left so Oh my god you're right
21:36
Well but yeah actually we have three Shut up No we have two We don't have
21:41
access the last week of school Oh cuz we have finals I can't believe that's so close Anyway
21:48
back to the topic at hand So now you're going to be out of the
21:55
game right do you think that you'll still keep tabs of the game or spectate it even just see what's going on see
22:01
where it's going maybe like every now and then but not probably not every turn
22:07
Yeah I mean like naturally we'll hear about it cuz like that's all like the people who are playing are talking about
22:13
I guess in class but I mean anyways and we're still on the group chat so I'll
22:19
probably look I'm not too invested in it cuz like I don't know Yeah because
22:25
you're not playing yet Yeah of course you're not too invested in it But just to Sorry go ahead Ernest Uh I
22:34
was just on the topic of other social deduction games that you might want to introduce in the future We could do
22:41
um jungle whatever it's called I might try that That'd be cool But that's an unrelated note We can get to that when
22:48
we get there Basically even though I you said you're not invested so I guess I'm just asking
22:55
you to humor me when I ask who do you think is in the best position to win so
23:02
far uh probably Austria
23:12
Why do you say that um I think they have well I didn't count but I they have
23:20
well one of the countries with the most supply centers and also all of their units are very like close to each other
23:27
and so they can easily support each other I feel like whereas like some
23:32
other countries where they're spread out they might be like harder to support each other They might lose a unit
23:40
I see I I think the situation Why don't Tommy should Tomvie should
23:47
express her opinion first probably Yeah I I agree with her I think Austria is
23:52
probably has the best chance of winning just because they're I think they also they have the most
23:59
clear like direction of what where they're trying to go and the best idea whereas like other countries are a
24:04
little bit more fragmented like Karini said And also I think just like the players like I think Seline and Gabe are
24:11
just they're probably the most invested in our class in this like or at least
24:16
like they're the most like serious about it from what it seems like I don't know They seem to have like
24:22
a pretty thoughtout strategy So yeah
24:30
I I think that the situation in the bottom right
24:36
corner is dynamic and and depending depending on
24:42
which way I end up you'll see one side ending on top I think that
24:49
um it's hard to tell who's going to win in my opinion What do you think Ken i think generally the same thing because
24:56
as soon as someone gets the upper hand others are encouraged to bring him down How about another question where
25:04
I'm basically asking you to humor me Who do you think aside from Turkey will be
25:10
the next person to join you at the losers table
25:17
uh well after Turkey
25:25
probably France or England I think France They're the most like
25:32
surrounded like everyone's going there I guess Yeah
25:38
Yeah That's an interesting take And I think the last question for us to round
25:44
it all off would probably be if you could do it all over again
25:51
what would you do different and what what what would you do that
25:56
would show that you've learned from your mistakes here
26:02
um okay Tommy can go first I think I probably would have just like
26:08
helped Italy first instead of going for Russia and tried to just commit to
26:15
England and France first instead of trying to do both Like
26:20
um when we first started we were like okay let's just take out England and like that'll be our first thing And then
26:27
like we kind of then like started flippy floppy So I think
26:33
that like if we had just continued down that path it might have been better
26:40
But yeah Yeah I agree with Tonv Like probably just not like also I think we shouldn't
26:47
have um backstabbed so many people at the start because I think we made some
26:53
enemies But I think that okay honestly that was probably going to happen regardless So I think just like having
26:59
like stronger alliances probably in with Italy too Yeah we just like I think like
27:06
we didn't like strategize which meant and so which was Yeah Part of that was
27:11
not making like good alliances and also like I don't know it's kind of like we were like more like surviving each round
27:18
than like or like we were like playing it by each round instead of like overtime which I guess like you kind of have to
27:24
do to some I think like we could have balanced both better maybe
27:35
Do you guys have any questions for us
27:41
what do you think is the best country to have or to start with well I think it's
27:46
your favorite I think it's fine to tell you guys since you're not going to be a factor anymore
27:52
Personally likely likely likely there's a small chance Um but
27:58
um just from like uh just from like a professional uh perspective France is
28:06
the best country to play They have the best naturally defensive area and they
28:11
can be both a significant army power and a fleet power But in terms of I do those
28:17
I think I'd like the um tournament level France actually has the highest win rate
28:22
And at a personal level though I really like playing Russia because Russia
28:28
really really really needs to focus on playing a very diplomatic game They have
28:36
very tense relationships with all four of its neighbors and all four of its neighbors can have a big impact on them
28:44
In order to win as Russia you need to be a very good sweet talker and I'm very glad that Ove got that role
28:52
I disagree with Kenan I think England is still the best country person It's a
28:57
personal favorite right just because you have to play with the sws of ocean that
29:03
surround you and also that leads to interesting dynamics between Russia
29:10
Germany and France And I think that that the the capacity for things to
29:18
go one way or swing the other way completely in the other direction is very it's very high probability for
29:24
England And that's why I like it And I guess I guess to make you guys feel a little bit better Germany is typically
29:31
ranked as like bottom three most of the time Yeah The the the worst three countries are Italy Austria and Germany
29:39
because they're in the center of the board [Music]
29:45
So Do you have any other questions for us
29:53
well I'm very sorry that your game is probably ending here It was a thrill to
29:58
have you guys and I'm so glad that you took the ta you took the chance to play this You took the All right shut up
30:05
Even though it may not have been exactly what you were expecting I hope you guys gained some meaningful fun or you know
30:15
some meaningful anything out of this because that was my goal all along And as long as you have that little bit then
30:22
I'm content with leaving it at that Yeah we definitely did
30:28
It was the experience of a lifetime It helped you transcend
30:34
Mhm Okay Thank you guys Thank you Tommy
30:40
Thank you Harini I'll be seeing you tomorrow Okay Bye Survive
30:46
Bye guys Bye
