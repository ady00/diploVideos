0:00
um so the way we're going to be doing
0:02
this is a little bit different than last
0:04
time Instead of um asking how you're
0:08
thinking and what your thoughts are
0:09
currently right now we're going to do
0:12
like a seasonal season by season basis
0:15
kind of thing And the way we're going to
0:16
do that is through screen share So I'll
0:18
just pull up my my screen right now
0:22
And here
0:24
um let me just let me just make sure
0:26
everything's good Um so this was the
0:31
turn No not this This was the turn where
0:35
we left off
0:37
Um last time So there are a couple
0:41
interesting things happening here You
0:43
are accepting French support into
0:46
Belgium when you were working with
0:47
Germany earlier What made you uh change
0:51
sides
0:53
France Wait France sent us a message
0:57
being like "Oh we're sorry." Wait I
1:01
think so right Yeah they did Okay And
1:04
then why did we not work with Germany We
1:07
ended up not working with Germany
1:08
because pretty much it was the only way
1:09
for us to get onto the mainland because
1:11
we we figured out that like if we had
1:14
kept on allying with um Italy and
1:17
Germany and the way that like they were
1:19
doing it there would basically be no
1:21
land left for us by like the time that
1:23
they like cuz they were expecting a lot
1:25
of support and they were like "Oh like
1:27
you guys can have like like we can
1:29
support you guys into other areas into
1:31
um in the future." But like it we we saw
1:36
that like by that by the time that that
1:38
future would come around it would be
1:41
like there would be like nothing left in
1:43
the area So we were saying that
1:45
if France was willing to go back to our
1:47
original deal to work together to take
1:49
out Germany then it would actually be
1:52
more beneficial for us because it would
1:54
give us like the north land um and then
1:58
give France sort of like a southern area
1:59
which is kind of the route that we're
2:01
going now And this is funny because
2:04
literally I think the the interview
2:06
right before we did
2:08
this not working with France like and
2:11
then and then we accepted our help
2:12
because they were so nice and funny how
2:15
things change Would you consider your
2:17
friendship with France to be a long-term
2:20
alliance of sorts
2:23
I think we still take it like round by
2:26
season by season but it has turned out
2:28
to be a pretty long term and like we do
2:30
trust them right as of right now Yes Yes
2:33
I agree We'll be returning to that topic
2:35
as we get closer to the present but how
2:38
about more how about more on this phase
2:40
real quick What are your thoughts on
2:43
Russia moving their north coast fleet in
2:45
St Petersburg to Norway
2:49
We don't like Russia We don't like
2:51
Russia
2:53
Russia Russia I think that Okay The
2:56
thing about Russia is during this round
2:59
I remember that they I think that they
3:02
claimed that they would support
3:04
us I believe into Denmark
3:07
They Yeah Yeah But we never we didn't
3:10
believe them which is why we supported
3:12
from Sweden Mhm You or like we supported
3:16
from North Sea and then we came in from
3:18
Sweden you because we didn't believe
3:20
that they would have supported us and
3:21
they didn't So we the orders say that
3:23
you held in Sweden Yeah you held your
3:25
unit in Sweden instead of using it to
3:27
attack Denmark here Wait so did we not
3:30
What did we do Wait so so Denmark is
3:33
Denmark here is supporting the Baltic
3:35
Sea Fleet into Sweden
3:38
Oh wait wait What happened I remember
3:41
that this was the turn that you asked
3:44
why um St Pete couldn't move into Norway
3:46
Yeah I don't remember what we were
3:48
thinking The Baltic Sea Fleet didn't get
3:51
into Sweden right Yeah Because because
3:53
they didn't order themselves to move
3:54
into Sweden The Denmark support failed
3:57
Oh yeah Okay Oh so that's what the
4:00
support Yeah That's why we didn't we
4:02
didn't even like do any support or
4:04
anything cuz Russia had told us they
4:07
were going to support us into Denmark
4:08
from the Baltic Sea Yeah And then they
4:11
took our thing
4:13
Well but Oh wait Sorry But but um what
4:17
when it happened like we weren't super
4:19
mad about it because
4:21
um I think we did stab Russia first a
4:25
few rounds back So there was that and so
4:27
we weren't like so we were like okay and
4:29
also them taking Norway is not the best
4:32
move for them cuz that especially now if
4:34
you look at the map now like that
4:35
corners them off cuz we're we surround
4:37
them on all sides
4:39
I see So really it was it was all
4:41
according to plan
4:44
Sure Yes So the the other thing I want
4:48
to talk about um are you worried that
4:52
this these these order sets leave
4:55
Germany too open for everybody else and
4:57
not open enough for you guys
5:01
What do you mean by that Like do you
5:02
think that Russia and Austria will get
5:04
more of Germany than you will
5:10
Um honestly I don't know what Austria is
5:13
doing So I haven't really been keeping
5:14
tabs on them Although they ask us every
5:18
round what we're doing Selena always
5:19
comes she goes "So what are you guys
5:22
doing?" And we're like and we just don't
5:24
talk to her about it cuz we're like
5:25
"Girl I think you've captured her
5:28
essence very well." Yeah That Yeah I
5:30
actually head with the So yeah Yeah She
5:33
goes she goes "So like do you think um
5:38
Well sorry Go ahead Ernest
5:41
What are your thoughts
5:43
on I mean I guess this move set with
5:46
France holding three units Why do you
5:48
think France decided to do that
5:52
Um
5:56
why we think France decided to move out
5:58
where to to hold three units
6:03
we Okay Sorry I guess that's hard to
6:07
answer Okay Because I think about Sorry
6:10
you keep going I think
6:13
what it's because at this point I don't
6:15
think they had anywhere to go If you're
6:17
talking about this round I don't think
6:17
they had anywhere to go because like we
6:20
they they had a ship in um MAO right And
6:23
then we were obviously occupying English
6:24
Channel So their breast fleet can't go
6:25
anywhere And then their gasine fleet
6:27
like they pretty much have the space
6:29
around it So there's nowhere for it to
6:30
go And then they I think they needed to
6:32
hold on our side because Italy was
6:33
trying to get in So I think in this
6:35
particular case I don't think they went
6:37
anywhere because there was like no place
6:39
for them to go You mentioned Austria a
6:41
little earlier Do you see Austria as an
6:44
endgame ally or a long-term threat
6:49
Um I think Austria I mean personally I
6:54
think Austria will be an ally against
6:56
the
6:57
Russians Um because the Russians seem
7:00
they they're very opposed to the
7:01
Russians and the Russians are very wary
7:03
of the Austrians Um because Austrians
7:05
don't listen to them Um so I think they
7:09
could be a useful ally against the
7:10
Russians but I think they will be our
7:12
like biggest threat I think they're
7:14
everyone's biggest threat Austria
7:16
Absolutely I think that people are I
7:18
think that people are trusting Austria a
7:20
little bit too much I think except for
7:22
the Russians because I think that up
7:24
until this point because Germany and
7:26
Turkey were still on the map I think
7:28
everybody thinks that we're a lot
7:30
farther from them on the map than we
7:32
actually are I think that the threat is
7:35
becoming more real And I think that
7:37
Austria I agree with Jessica I think
7:38
that they will be an ally against Russia
7:40
but they will be our biggest long-term
7:42
threat I think Yeah Let's move on to the
7:45
next season where France destroys this
7:49
army in Picard and you build a fleet in
7:52
Inborboro Uh how about we start with
7:54
France Do you think that this
7:56
destruction in Picerty only solidifies
7:58
your alliance more or was it arranged or
8:02
something like that Can you can you
8:03
offer your thoughts please
8:10
I I don't remember It might have been
8:13
arranged because okay B what I know what
8:17
we had arranged was that they would help
8:19
us get into Belgium in that previous
8:21
season and then um eventually we would
8:25
move out of Belgium and they would move
8:27
in from Yeah Burgundy is that Burgundy
8:32
that is wait the Pigerty like them
8:34
destroying the Pigerty fleet isn't
8:36
wasn't by choice was it They they choose
8:38
which one to destroy I think I think
8:40
that was a thing of trust being like we
8:43
will destroy that this one and
8:44
then we won't wait Okay I don't know
8:49
Yeah Cuz I think that they cuz they had
8:50
to destroy they had to destroy one
8:52
anyways So I think that that was I think
8:56
part of their show of good faith I think
8:59
that was part of it But I think that it
9:01
was also just because like they
9:02
literally like they need to destroy one
9:04
anyways And if they destroy the one in
9:07
Burgundy
9:09
obviously that lets Germany move in and
9:12
they can't destroy anything like near
9:13
Italy because that like Italy was I
9:15
think was their biggest threat at the
9:17
time So let's talk about your Go ahead
9:20
Well I mean um same
9:23
question Why did you decide to build a
9:25
fleet in Edinberg
9:28
Um so that we can go to NWG and surround
9:30
Norway and take a bath from the Russians
9:33
Yeah because the way that we were
9:34
thinking about it is we were trying to
9:37
we were trying to see if we could force
9:39
um Norway into um the Scandinavian Sea I
9:42
think like Norway fleet cuz if they had
9:44
to retreat we were hoping that we could
9:46
force them there and then cut them off
9:50
somehow I think that's what we were
9:52
trying to do
9:53
Either way it it seemed to work because
9:55
Russia was very wary about the presence
9:58
of that fleet and they still were up
10:00
until the round where this round where
10:02
we actually did take Sweden
10:04
back or sorry excuse me sorry Norway All
10:08
right let's move on to the next phase
10:10
here where it is just you're just
10:13
butchering Germany right here Did you
10:15
feel bad at all for Germany or was it no
10:18
remorse
10:20
no remorse because um they had told us
10:24
that they were like not playing the game
10:25
anymore So they're like we'll just do
10:27
whatever you ask us to do So they
10:29
literally didn't they like support us
10:31
into something They support they did not
10:34
this rounded Sweden They supported you
10:36
to Sweden the first round
10:39
Okay Not this round I think it's the
10:41
next round This this one was I think at
10:43
this point Germany was still in the game
10:45
and I think they quit because
10:48
they got too many territories taken this
10:49
round Um
10:52
I mean did we feel bad for it I don't
10:55
know I don't I don't think so cuz like
10:59
I'm not actually taking anyone's land
11:01
Like it's a game Like I didn't feel bad
11:02
I was like okay like
11:05
all right Also like we after our like
11:07
very initial alliance with Germany like
11:10
we kind of just lost contact and there
11:11
was never any like like building of
11:14
trust or anything So I don't think there
11:16
was any like established relationship
11:17
that we were breaking Yeah The only the
11:20
only relationship that I think that we I
11:22
do feel kind of bad about is we had um
11:25
we had sort of like an early term cuz
11:28
like cuz like we explained in the first
11:29
interviews like we don't we don't have
11:32
like established long-term alliances We
11:34
do take things round by round and the
11:36
fact that France is a long-term ally is
11:38
just by virtue of the fact that we we
11:41
continue to benefit from each other
11:42
round by round But I think that like we
11:45
did have like an early like if you want
11:47
to consider like long-term like
11:49
long-term alliance with Italy And I
11:51
think that because Italy trusted us and
11:54
Germany to sort of take out France us
11:57
going and working with France to take
11:58
out Germany without really like letting
12:02
Italy know I think that that might have
12:04
sort of been a little bit I felt a
12:06
little bit bad about
12:07
that but yeah
12:10
I see I see
12:13
So do you think that it's better for
12:17
France to be struggling with Italy or
12:19
it's better for France to be doing well
12:21
against Italy
12:25
I think it's better for them to be
12:27
struggling against Italy because if they
12:30
were doing well they would probably
12:31
start focusing on us But as of now
12:33
they're leaving us alone because
12:36
they're they need to like focus on Italy
12:38
So I'm a little worried about what will
12:41
happen when either Italy or France like
12:43
are free because then they'll occupy
12:45
like that whole area and then they'll
12:48
only have like one person which is us to
12:50
look at Yeah we're going to need to have
12:53
fleets in um Liverpool and stuff cuz
12:56
then if we if we occupy the if we occupy
12:59
the entire sea surrounding us they can't
13:00
get to our they can't get in our waters
13:04
you know
13:06
Mhm Yeah But I think that for the
13:10
upcoming build
13:11
rounds at least for now I don't think
13:14
that we're going to be building there
13:15
because we do have the intention to sort
13:16
of try to take over the the northern
13:19
Russian territories like the never the
13:22
the north the northeastern like Russian
13:24
territories Like we want to try to move
13:26
into there
13:29
somehow All right Um let's see
13:36
Uh do you think it's better for Austria
13:40
to be doing well in like currently on
13:42
this turn Do you think it was better
13:45
would it be better for Austria to be
13:46
doing well in the southeast or Russia to
13:49
be doing well in the
13:58
southeast I honestly don't know what's
14:00
going on over there
14:03
I think it's like it's nice to have
14:05
Russia focusing on the southeast because
14:09
then they kind of leave
14:10
their like the northeast like kind of
14:14
defenseless which makes it easier for us
14:16
like when um if we like do eventually
14:19
want to go in there It's kind of like
14:20
the same thing with like Italy and
14:22
France As long as Austria and Russia are
14:24
occupied with each other we're fine with
14:26
that
14:27
And I think that it's better for I think
14:30
Austria to be doing better this round
14:33
cuz right now Russia has eight
14:35
territories I think and so they have so
14:38
do you and so does Austria
14:40
No we have we have seven don't we You
14:42
have eight now currently We have eight
14:44
now Okay But at the time like Russia had
14:49
eight territories And I think
14:52
that I think that also because the less
14:57
land that Russia gets the less they'll
14:59
be able to build which means that the
15:01
more defenseless their home bases will
15:03
be for when we try to move in
15:06
All right I would say that's so for Yeah
15:08
So for now Austria that would just be
15:10
that's just good tactics I got to say Um
15:13
moving on to the next season
15:17
Um it appears that you chose to leave
15:20
Norway alone this turn What motivated
15:22
that decision
15:26
Um oh Amber had a really good idea for
15:28
this Do you want to explain the like
15:30
cutting Russia off and Yeah So basically
15:34
we had I could I could read out the text
15:37
I sent to Jessica Actually this might be
15:38
more interesting for your little docue
15:40
series Hold on Wait let me find We could
15:42
also just screenshot the text Wait
15:44
actually read out the text but also
15:45
screenshot it out So when And I'll text
15:48
you guys Sure Compare the text over with
15:51
your voice Okay I
15:55
said okay before this round I
16:03
said okay I think I think this is the
16:05
correct round Give me really quick for a
16:07
second
16:10
Um okay So I said considering this
16:14
development uh with Russia cuz at the
16:17
time I didn't understand that you
16:18
couldn't like build fleets in like areas
16:20
that like were your home like area So I
16:23
was at first suggesting I was thinking
16:24
like we could build a fleet on um the
16:28
Scandinavian shore of Sweden and then
16:30
move into Denmark with that But that
16:31
wouldn't work anyway So basically I said
16:34
we we could build a fleet by Edinburg
16:37
and move it to um NWG and that way we
16:40
isolate the Russian fleet in Norway
16:42
which is what we already did And that
16:44
way because it it takes them two turns
16:45
for them to move into Denmark we can
16:47
move into the um the Nth fleet into
16:50
Denmark with support from the Swedish
16:52
army right Mhm I think
16:55
um looking at Wait wait What was my
16:58
reasoning here Jessica Do you remember
16:59
Okay So basically um sorry I don't
17:02
remember Basically we originally I was
17:05
like let's go for Norway Like we're
17:06
surrounding them But then um Amber was
17:10
saying that Norway would retreat into um
17:13
SKA and then they could get Germany's
17:16
help to get either like Sweden or Yeah
17:20
they could get Germany's help to get
17:21
into Sweden instead Yeah So then Amber
17:24
was like let's wait a minute Okay Let's
17:26
go Let's move Nth into Denmark Um let's
17:32
move NWG into U then North Sea And then
17:35
because Norway
17:38
um would have to move into NWG and then
17:40
we would just build in Edinburgh and
17:43
then we would like surround them in NWG
17:46
So they wouldn't want to do that So they
17:47
were just going to hold in Norway We
17:48
know that And then we got this is around
17:50
where Germany was like we'll just do
17:52
whatever you want So we got them to help
17:54
us um like basically occupy the Russians
17:57
and K so that they wouldn't um so that
18:01
they wouldn't do anything fishy I don't
18:02
really remember what we're worried of
18:03
them doing but we we were just like
18:05
"Greaty can you help us occupy the
18:08
Russians and make that sure they're
18:09
they're busy so that we can get into
18:11
Denmark and then that way when we attack
18:13
Norway um they will be surrounded and
18:15
they can only go into SK but then we
18:17
would surround them anyways there." Yeah
18:18
Do you think this was a good plan and
18:20
did it work I mean it worked right Yeah
18:23
I think it was definitely a good
18:25
thinking on Ember's part because
18:27
originally I was like let's just go for
18:28
Norway and I didn't think that like but
18:30
then Amber was like but then we leave
18:32
Sweden vulnerable if Germany stays in
18:34
There are always consequences It's good
18:37
It's a good way to think if you do this
18:38
what will happen next And also it would
18:41
sorry it also it would be a lot better
18:43
for them for us to cut them off from
18:45
Denmark which I think is what we were
18:47
trying to do at the point because
18:49
because then through Denmark they can
18:52
also access like pretty much all of like
18:54
the other territories in that area Like
18:55
they can they can go in through um HL
18:58
they can go into Holland they can like
19:00
support like Keel into Holland if they
19:02
wanted to like it would have a lot of
19:04
risks if they were able to get into the
19:06
Denmark territory So we it would be it
19:08
was always better to cut them off and
19:10
like keep them in this like to keep them
19:12
in Norway and we could always just take
19:14
Norway afterwards Yeah I think it was
19:16
kind of like that The other interesting
19:17
thing about this phase I would say is
19:20
Austria holding all units Do you think
19:23
that is anything worth commenting on Bro
19:28
yes Because Gabe was like Gabe was like
19:31
"Please Ken please I did it on purpose
19:34
Please Kenan believe me I I'm smart I'm
19:37
Gabe and I'm smart and I held my armies
19:40
on purpose okay It's not because I can't
19:43
make a decision without Seline It's
19:45
because I'm smart by myself I'm Gabe And
19:50
believe me Kenan I did this on purpose
19:55
Nice Because clearly if he wanted to he
19:57
could have moved into Munich
19:59
Why not He has two armies there Why not
20:02
Yeah And there's like no one else like
20:04
that's going to like Italy is occupied
20:06
and like I don't know Yeah Everybody
20:08
else is busy Like everybody else is busy
20:11
They know that Russia is scared of them
20:13
Worst case like Russia um the fleet in
20:16
Berlin the fleet in Berlin can even move
20:18
there you know like they why don't they
20:21
just take Munich you know Oh wait sorry
20:24
It's a very good question and you will
20:26
have your question answered when you see
20:28
their perspective on why they held Yes
20:31
you you'll see what a said um two other
20:35
things impressions aside of Gabe aside
20:38
two other interesting things that
20:40
happened that uh pertains to you is the
20:44
move from Mur into Belgium and the hold
20:46
in the English Channel Uh why did you do
20:49
both of those moves or why did you agree
20:51
that France would move into Belgium or
20:53
not when you could have clearly
20:55
prevented them from doing so using the
20:57
English channel
21:00
Um it was a previous deal we had made
21:02
with them that like if they would help
21:04
us get into Belgium just so that we
21:05
could get on the mainland then we would
21:07
give them Belgium afterwards And I think
21:10
it was just like a show of like trust I
21:13
guess France is our like strongest ally
21:15
and we wanted to keep that ally for now
21:17
Um and I think that like one thing about
21:19
us I think is that
21:21
like I think that it's like we don't
21:24
back that people unless we have to Like
21:26
I think that it's like I think it's like
21:27
at the time like I think initially like
21:29
when we were very desperate to get onto
21:30
the mainland like it was very much like
21:31
we were like trying to make like like
21:35
any way to get on the mainland But I
21:36
think that it's like I think that we're
21:38
good for our word Like even even at the
21:41
very beginning like when we if we have
21:44
like a relationship built with you or if
21:45
we have a deal struck we're pretty much
21:47
good for our word because the only
21:48
reason why we went after France in the
21:50
first round was because they stabbed us
21:51
but like we went through with not like
21:54
moving into breast like we're pretty
21:56
good on like if we say that we're going
21:58
to do something like we will but if we
22:01
if we're a little bit I think we're a
22:02
little bit obvious like when we're about
22:04
to
22:05
like break ties with somebody cuz again
22:08
like we don't have long-term alliances
22:09
It's not really like a betrayal I think
22:12
It's more just like if we stop
22:13
communicating with you and we don't say
22:15
that we're going to do something we're
22:16
not going to do it But if we say that we
22:17
do something we're pretty much going to
22:18
do it you know
22:22
Okay honest players That's what you guys
22:25
said before Also I got to go in like a
22:27
little bit in like two minutes Okay Well
22:30
let's try and go fast here then Um
22:32
Jessica do you think you can stay after
22:34
Amber leaves Um I can stay for like five
22:36
more minutes after set So you built a
22:39
fleet in Ed Inber Russia built an army
22:41
in St Pete Clearly things are rising
22:43
Tensions are rising Um and yeah I mean
22:47
like do you have anything else to add
22:50
Uh well we just did that so that we
22:52
could get Norway eventually Makes sense
22:54
We're going to move on because we do
22:55
want to get through the entire year Um
22:58
long year Yeah So I don't think this is
23:03
by far the least interesting phase in my
23:05
opinion Although we do have Austria
23:07
coming in and taking Munich Did you feel
23:10
like at in any sense like sad that they
23:14
were doing it because Munich could have
23:15
been yours or it could have been France
23:19
I didn't really think about that I don't
23:21
think it could have been ours because I
23:23
think that we would have too many it
23:25
would require too many moves I think for
23:28
us to get in there I think
23:30
it like I don't think that we could have
23:32
relied on Russian support to get in And
23:36
also like right here like look at him
23:38
He's there He's I'm saying he because I
23:40
don't think this is Seline I think this
23:42
is Gabe Okay He he he is like he's
23:45
like I didn't move I didn't move my
23:48
armies on purpose And he's making the
23:50
move that he should have made like two
23:51
rounds ago
23:53
Well all right Next question Yeah So the
23:57
next I'll just take any opportunity to
23:58
rag on those guys The next phase it
24:00
appears that it's smooth sailing for you
24:02
guys This is I mean like I don't think
24:04
there's much to comment on You
24:05
successfully take out Norway And also by
24:08
the way Russia just messaged us He chose
24:11
to disband this fleet not retreat it
24:14
Interesting Interesting
24:17
I would have expected them to retreat
24:19
into NWG to try to get into our
24:20
territories B A R whatever that is You
24:24
can't retreat into the place that you
24:25
are attacked from But you wouldn't know
24:27
that because you wouldn't have you'd
24:29
never had to retreat before So good on
24:31
you So wait I have a I have a question
24:35
So what happened in um what happened to
24:41
keeping Russia from retreating into skin
24:44
um into um into skyrack because Denmark
24:48
is currently open right now unless you
24:50
just were going to cover it by moving
24:52
fleets back into it I think it's called
24:54
like skyrack right skyrack cuz it would
24:57
I think it would take them like two
24:59
moves to move into it Yeah And plus we
25:01
could we have Sweden and the and we also
25:03
have ke I guess Yeah All right So
25:06
general questions just so that we're
25:08
here and also you have two builds Please
25:11
get that to me by midnight The um the
25:14
other thing that I wanted to talk about
25:17
What do you think is the most important
25:18
thing for you to do going forward aside
25:21
from like killing Russia at this point
25:23
What do you what are your next steps
25:26
um being wary of Austria because they're
25:29
we're like for them now Like this is
25:33
pretty bad Oh we might need to try to
25:35
deal with Russia to leave them alone for
25:37
now and in exchange for so assistance
25:40
against or actually they just talk to
25:42
France Yeah And we're going to we're
25:44
going to be building more armies to
25:46
convoy over because we are basically
25:48
entirely fleets except for one I think
25:50
Yeah we're like completely marine Okay
25:54
Um Ernest do you have any last minute
25:55
questions
25:57
