0:00
all right well if Samir and Mji aren't
0:03
going to join do you think we should
0:05
just start without him for now i guess
0:07
so yeah Samir will hopefully join later
0:10
okay
0:12
so coming into this game Adve when you
0:15
saw that you have you had you were
0:17
assigned Russia like what were your
0:19
initial plans and your like strategy
0:23
that you thought you were going to use
0:25
throughout this game
0:26
well initially I mean move one the goal
0:30
was fight on two fronts right take
0:33
control of
0:34
Scandinavia and then try to secure a
0:37
stake for myself in the Balkans right
0:39
and the idea was long term we'd either
0:42
bulldo or I'd either bulldoze with the
0:44
help of either Austria Turkey the other
0:45
one with the help of Turkey bulldoze
0:47
Austria with the help of Austria bulldo
0:49
Turkey um it seems that hasn't gone
0:52
entirely to plan yet i still think we
0:55
can work something out because the Turk
0:58
the Turkish player has left some um some
1:02
gaps in their armor so how'd you go
1:05
about negotiating with Austria and
1:07
Turkey and also with uh the Western
1:10
powers for Scandinavia
1:13
well I mean evidently it wasn't great
1:15
negotiation judging by the state of the
1:17
board right now but with the Western
1:19
powers um I oriented myself to ally with
1:22
France uh the idea was France is going
1:26
to be a natural enemy of England
1:28
therefore me and Scandinavia is only
1:30
good for the French interest seeing as
1:33
the English player from the get-go is
1:34
very aggressive they occupy the English
1:36
channel that's very very um aggressive
1:39
towards the French and so me and Sean
1:42
Shawn and uh Alena who are the French
1:44
players um shared a I would say
1:48
healthier relationship as far as the
1:50
Balkans go um that was tumultuous that
1:52
was very uh that was very uh choppy we
1:56
tried to arrange a deal with the Turks
1:58
so they could occupy Serbia it seems
2:00
that deal was ignored and instead the
2:02
Serbs or the the Turks combined with the
2:04
Austrians chose to occupy our Romania
2:07
and now the Austrians seem to be uh
2:10
angling towards Bulgaria which is
2:12
Turkish so it's a very dangerous
2:13
situation
2:18
so now that you have this current state
2:21
of the board what is your plan moving
2:24
forward what is the uh what is the
2:26
solution that you think will get you out
2:28
of this mess
2:30
well there have to be two solutions
2:32
right because we've got Germany right
2:34
there outside Warsaw and we've got the
2:36
Austrians and Turks in Romania right now
2:39
as we speak for the Germans the thought
2:41
process is they are very capable to
2:45
capture Warsaw but our fleet in the
2:48
Baltic Sea is also threatening KE so I
2:52
believe we've come to negotiation at
2:53
least I hope the German players uh agree
2:55
with me in my ascent
2:58
that they will recoil their troops and
3:01
bring them back to Berlin and back to
3:03
Munich on the condition that I don't
3:05
occupy Kon this turn with my Baltic Sea
3:08
fleet and in return the Germans will
3:12
support me back into Sweden because they
3:15
actually didn't want England in the
3:16
North Sea so them supporting me back
3:18
into England would be their way to get
3:20
back in England and additionally a
3:22
weaker England is only good for Germany
3:23
and good for France because it just
3:24
leaves more centers on the board for
3:26
them do you think there's any scenario
3:27
where you would instead seek English
3:30
help against the Germans
3:32
the issue is of the Russians are going
3:35
to be a natural enemy of the English
3:37
right or
3:39
see we both fight for um overlordship
3:43
over Scandinavia and as a result there
3:46
isn't a world where we can both coexist
3:48
peacefully i mean I could certainly look
3:50
for English help to take Denmark for
3:52
instance but I feel like it's more
3:54
fruitful to pursue a German alliance
3:57
against the English even now even when
3:59
the Germans are right outside the gates
4:01
of Warsaw all right so how do you uh
4:04
seek to resolve your issues in the
4:06
Balkans with Austria and Turkey
4:09
you see the relationship that Austria
4:11
and Turkey have is very unstable
4:14
especially with Bulgaria completely wide
4:16
open right now so I'd like to undermine
4:19
their allyship because if Russia were to
4:22
fall which is very possible it's the
4:24
Turks who gain everything and the
4:26
Austrians who didn't gain much even last
4:28
turn it was the Turks who gained Romania
4:30
and if we were to suddenly collapse the
4:33
Turks would be in a better position to
4:35
take up all of our centers because we
4:38
have Golia in the way of Austria whereas
4:40
there's nothing in the way of Turkey to
4:41
catch Sebastapole and catch Moscow and
4:43
then St petersburg so we're trying to
4:46
play at both sides over there with that
4:47
angle where we entice the Austrians to
4:50
attack Bulgaria and we entice the Turks
4:53
to attack Serbia and hopefully regain
4:56
Romania from that pandemonium but what
4:58
are you going to do that's different
4:59
than the beginning portion of the game
5:02
for whatever reason they decided that it
5:04
was in their benefit to attack Russia
5:07
what is it that you're going to do
5:08
differently this time that will sway
5:10
Austria onto your side that's a good
5:13
question and I think offer Austria
5:16
Romania entirely um I think that having
5:19
seen the situation in the Balkans it
5:20
makes no sense for the Russians to uh
5:23
introduce ourselves and I think will
5:25
focus on more northern interests that
5:27
being capturing Norway and Sweden so if
5:30
we were to offer Austro Romania which is
5:31
what they wanted from the start we could
5:33
then probably entice them to go for
5:35
Bulgaria instead and I believe that
5:38
initially we were too greedy that we
5:40
wanted to have our cake and eat it too
5:42
as Mr mcbride would say we wanted both
5:44
Scandinavia and Romania to be ours and
5:46
that just wouldn't work so I think we'll
5:48
offer the Austrians Romania entirely and
5:50
in turn we hope that they will go for
5:52
the Turks instead
5:55
ernest do you have anything to say well
5:57
yeah so earlier you talked about how
6:01
Austria gained little centers but they
6:03
were in good position to take more which
6:06
nation do you think is currently
6:10
underestimated uh but they're in prime
6:12
position to take a lot of territory
6:16
h that's a good question i would say to
6:19
the Austrians because the Austrians and
6:20
Italians from what I see have enjoyed a
6:23
alliance of some sort and if the
6:25
Austrians are smart which they are um
6:28
they if they were to strike first could
6:30
very easily the Italians um
6:33
right now Venice is completely unguarded
6:35
there's an army in Triest we could see
6:38
as soon as next turn the Austrians
6:39
strike into the mainland of Italy
6:42
capture Venice and capturing Venice just
6:44
takes away one of Italy's most integral
6:48
units because Italy is currently on the
6:50
weaker end they only have four units to
6:52
spare so taking Venice would totally
6:54
Italy and that would be one less
6:56
competitor for the Austrians similarly
6:59
Russia is on the defensive it's pushed
7:01
up against the wall right now so the
7:03
Austrians have very little in terms of
7:06
effective opponents against them even
7:08
the Turks are dependent on Austrian help
7:10
to take Russia so the Austrians are
7:12
playing a good game so far you said
7:15
overrated too underrated overrated what
7:17
else
7:19
um I think that was a good answer
7:22
um you talked earlier about your
7:24
alliance with Germany or your France the
7:28
sorry your alliance with France but you
7:30
also want to build one with Germany
7:33
when if ever do you think you'll have to
7:34
stab them
7:36
france i mean the thing is Russia and
7:40
France naturally synergize seeing as
7:42
we're so far away on the board right if
7:46
Russia is to survive this and if France
7:47
is to survive the Italian fleet circling
7:49
the Mediterranean I believe we won't be
7:52
stabbing each other until far far into
7:54
the endgame into the uh twilight years
7:57
of of this board game just because
8:00
there's so many centers in between us
8:02
that we can both individually go for and
8:04
we both have our own enemies right
8:06
although we do share England as a common
8:08
foe we're going to stick more towards
8:10
the Scandinavian side of things and
8:12
they're going to stick more towards the
8:13
English mainland so as long as we
8:15
respect our individual domains much
8:17
stabbing would happen until far far
8:19
later and if you theoretically if you
8:23
successfully manage to gain a
8:25
partnership with either Germany or
8:27
Austria when do you think that you will
8:29
eventually need to turn on those people
8:32
that will be far sooner um if we are to
8:35
survive this ordeal and let's say we
8:36
gain the allyship of both Austria and
8:39
Germany hopefully Germany does go back
8:41
to Berlin and Munich and hopefully I
8:44
would like Germany and Austria to fight
8:47
against one another seeing as they're
8:50
far close they are very close on the map
8:52
it's just Tiberi and Bohemia between the
8:53
two uh the Austrians are also in a great
8:56
positioning to take over Tiberian and
8:58
Bohemia soon and start threatening those
9:00
German centers and when they do it will
9:03
be very dangerous for a German player so
9:05
if we are to ally with the Germans and
9:07
the Austrians we would like other
9:09
countries to do the primary attacks for
9:12
us and then we will um like vultures
9:15
peck at the remaining centers
9:20
so how would you describe your approach
9:24
to negotiations
9:27
well negotiating wise I always so I have
9:30
like my own map of the board i have my
9:32
own web web diplomacy map and when
9:35
negotiating I've tried to to my allies
9:39
showcase this is guaranteed this isn't
9:42
guaranteed there's a 50-50 chance of
9:44
this happening and really just utilize
9:46
hard numbers or hard logic to get my
9:49
point across evidently that hasn't
9:51
worked um because the Austrian 2 is
9:53
smart and the Austrian 2 has utilized uh
9:56
numbers and logic in their reasoning
9:58
behind the game but I think that
10:02
hopefully if we can convince the Turk to
10:05
uh you know or if we could just wait the
10:07
Turk to go against Austria this turn and
10:09
the Austrian to go against the Turk this
10:11
turn we could continue to utilize that
10:14
uh worldview of just showcasing a map
10:18
and utilizing the you know facts of the
10:21
map to talk for us instead of us having
10:24
to rely upon our ethos to persuade
10:27
others
10:30
well when would ethos need to be used i
10:34
think right now is when ethos need to be
10:36
used i think appealing to the fact that
10:38
Russia is in a very weak position um and
10:41
the fact that the Austrians if they were
10:43
to go for the Turks would be beneficial
10:45
to them in the long run because they
10:47
have nothing to gain from a completely
10:49
decimated Russia except for a very
10:51
strong Turkey and vice versa with regard
10:54
to the Turks would be the best time to
10:57
apply ethos because right now um the
11:00
Russians aren't we the Russians aren't
11:02
in a position to negotiate much and to
11:05
take what we're given and as a result it
11:07
only makes sense for us to appeal to the
11:09
Austrians and the Turks and try to
11:12
convince them to play against one
11:14
another do you think that the Austrians
11:16
and the Turks and in a sense Germany and
11:18
England as well were justified in host
11:22
in presenting hostility towards you or
11:26
do you think it was irrational
11:28
i think it depends so
11:31
um if you look at my turns from last
11:33
move I was actually from last move very
11:37
supportive of the Turkish effort to
11:39
colonize Austria um I like um according
11:42
to my moves last turn all of my moves
11:44
were set to help the Turk into Serbia
11:47
that never panned out the Turk instead
11:50
attacked us but I could see Austria
11:52
wanting to attack us that makes sense
11:54
because we've been very anti-Asrian with
11:56
the Turk I don't see it as much but I
11:59
mean I suppose it was either us or it
12:01
was the Austrians and someone was bound
12:03
to be stabbed either way so I mean it's
12:05
not illogical
12:06
entirely with the English player it's a
12:10
good move their move lost only benefits
12:12
them so that stab is effective for the
12:15
German I don't see it the German is the
12:16
one move that I really didn't understand
12:18
i didn't understand what the English
12:20
player offered to the German that
12:22
enticed them to break our DMZ in Prussia
12:25
and Telisia and support the English
12:28
player into Sweden because the Germans
12:31
from what I see gain nothing from this
12:33
if they were to take Warsaw then we take
12:35
Kio and them supporting England into
12:37
Sweden only makes England stronger which
12:40
is a natural enemy of them so I would
12:44
say everything makes sense except for
12:45
the German fair's actions
12:48
now that would you have considered Sorry
12:51
let me repeat would you have considered
12:53
yourself a really really like in a
12:57
really really good position before this
12:59
turn that just happened
13:02
i would consider myself in a very
13:03
dangerous position and I suppose that
13:06
was or that was correct because I'm now
13:09
in a much worse off position i was in a
13:11
good position but the issue with good
13:12
positions in diplomacy is that
13:14
everyone's jealous of you right so
13:16
having a good position isn't actually
13:18
what you want you don't want to be the
13:19
strongest player on the board especially
13:20
early on because you don't have the
13:22
means and the actual size to completely
13:25
defend yourself from multiple countries
13:27
up against you i would love to be the
13:29
strongest country five six years down
13:31
the line because that would mean I have
13:32
the actual units and soldiers to support
13:35
myself from multiple countries from a
13:36
coalition attacking me but right now I
13:38
just wasn't in that position and even
13:41
though I did have more centers than I
13:43
think any other country I think us and
13:44
France were tied in terms of centers
13:46
coming into before this move we can see
13:49
the follyies of that because now every
13:50
country wants to g up against us seeing
13:52
as we have the most centers do you think
13:54
have the most
13:55
centers do you think following into next
13:59
year that you could use similar rhetoric
14:01
to make others turn on each other oh
14:04
very much so right now we're going to
14:05
see a very strong Austria if they are to
14:08
capture Bulgaria that is and if they are
14:10
to capture Bulgaria the Turk will
14:12
suddenly be uh without recourse for uh
14:15
defense of Romania so we could probably
14:18
convince the Turk to actually attack
14:20
Austria this time if they are to take
14:22
Serbia but I mean right now we'll just
14:25
have to see which country comes out on
14:27
top and that'll require elimination of
14:29
some country and most likely that's
14:32
going to be uh the Russian we are the
14:34
sick man of Europe now so following the
14:37
elimination of one of these countries
14:38
either Russia or the Turk or maybe even
14:42
France I'm not sure um we will begin to
14:44
see this rhetoric being used of whoa XYZ
14:48
players the strongest therefore we
14:49
should gang up against them
14:53
ernest do you have any questions
14:56
well moving forward other than appealing
14:59
to one's ethos what do you need to do
15:02
next
15:05
i mean hm truthfully I've been looking
15:08
into doing some fun moves so last turn
15:12
for instance the Turk tried to move into
15:14
the Black Sea or they cut support from
15:16
the Black Sea into Constantinople um and
15:19
that leaves a number of interesting
15:20
moves open like going from black instead
15:23
of supporting uh you know a certain
15:26
position from black sea instead of
15:28
supporting let's say Ukraine into
15:29
Romania what we could do is just do
15:32
black sea into Constantinople and that
15:34
would result in the Turk losing a center
15:36
because the Turk would move into Black
15:37
Sea and we would move into
15:39
Constantinople and seeing as wingy um
15:42
you can't switch positions like that
15:43
adve no no like Turk goes into Black Sea
15:47
we go into Constantinople That's it yeah
15:50
but you that'd be two two units swapping
15:52
positions without use of a convoy so you
15:54
can't do that what do you mean if the
15:57
units cannot swap positions if they go
15:59
from the same province to the other
16:01
province nothing happens no no like
16:03
let's say um if the fleet in Black Sea
16:04
moves to Constantinople and the fleet in
16:06
Constantinople moves to Black Sea they
16:09
just stay still because you can't swap
16:10
positions like that directly oh actually
16:13
okay that's good to know that's good to
16:15
know okay that's really good probably
16:18
was about to do that move i was actually
16:20
wait that that can't happen you can't
16:22
swap that was one of our that was one of
16:24
our our slides that we Oh I wasn't
16:26
paying much attention
16:28
but you are you are on the right track
16:31
figuring out what they are going to do
16:33
and reacting in response with a move set
16:35
that counters it is the very essence of
16:39
strategy and game theory in this game hm
16:42
what I could do then is because the Turk
16:44
loves to cut my support in Black Sea um
16:46
I will snake in Galsia to Romania i
16:48
could just do Black Sea to Romania
16:50
instead um and in that way the Turk does
16:53
get Black Sea but I will have Romania
16:55
back and that'll lose the center for
16:56
them that would work right well that is
17:00
if Constance Opal is moving actually
17:04
well I mean you can math it out you can
17:06
math it out it would probably work yeah
17:09
okay okay for sure i have game master
17:11
approval on this incredible no it's it's
17:13
not approval it's just like it's just
17:15
like fact that would work it would it
17:17
would truly i concur but yeah I mean
17:20
this is a fun game i do like this game
17:23
um this is exciting it's made me think a
17:24
lot so thank you guys for running this
17:27
this is super fun well we're not quite
17:29
yet done so we've gotten your thoughts
17:32
on England France Germany Austria and
17:35
Turkey but you haven't mentioned Italy
17:38
at all yet once except for a passing
17:41
mention of "Oh they're kind of weak what
17:44
are your thoughts on them what is your
17:45
read?"
17:47
Well Italy is championed by Mac and
17:48
Nathan and Max's played this game before
17:50
so um again Italy is a tough country to
17:53
play right usually you have the western
17:57
triangle over here with France Germany
17:59
and England and you have the Balkan
18:01
powers Austria Turkey and Russia
18:03
fighting it out and then you have Italy
18:04
in the center that's just tossed in to
18:06
create chaos and it seems for this game
18:08
Italy's chosen to pursue westward
18:11
instead of eastward which is a shame for
18:13
the Russian because it means that the
18:15
Austrian and the Turk have less
18:17
competition to fight it out in the
18:19
Mediterranean and it's bad for me too
18:21
because it means that my ally France is
18:23
going to have a tougher time to secure
18:25
their centers and make it harder for
18:27
them to fight back against the English
18:29
player i do believe that the Italian is
18:32
playing dangerously in the sense that
18:34
they've left Venice completely open
18:36
austria totally could at any time occupy
18:38
Venice with their triest army and that
18:40
might be their move next turn uh I'm not
18:42
sure so truly it is dangerous but Italy
18:45
is difficult to play with
18:47
um I do think that it makes more sense
18:50
for the Italian to seeing the tumult at
18:52
least in the Balkans serve as a
18:55
kingmaker essentially occupy the Ionian
18:57
occupy the Aian occupy the Adriatic if
18:59
they can because they are a naval power
19:02
and in turn essentially dictate who
19:06
controls and who doesn't control the
19:08
various Mediterranean provinces that
19:10
being Greece that being Bulgaria that
19:12
being maybe even Triest and Smeirna but
19:14
it seems they've gone to attack the
19:17
Frenchmen instead which is dangerous
19:19
because the Frenchman does have that
19:21
Portugal and Spanish center to fall back
19:24
upon and that just gives them a lot more
19:27
power essentially it makes it that much
19:29
more difficult for the Italian to crack
19:30
open the French defense but I mean I
19:33
suppose Mac and Nathan see something
19:35
that I don't i I I trust them to make
19:38
the right move well speaking about
19:40
making the right move you seem almost
19:42
convinced that the Austrians are going
19:44
to take Venice and that they're going to
19:46
take Bulgaria what makes you so certain
19:48
that this is going to happen when it
19:50
hasn't happened yet already well now
19:53
Bulgaria is completely open and so is
19:55
Venice at least in previous moves the
19:57
Italian attempted to keep up the facade
20:00
of being on mutual terms with the
20:02
Austrian but that's completely out the
20:03
window now venice is now occupied maybe
20:06
maybe uh Tuskanyany moves back to Venice
20:08
and there's a bounce in Venice happening
20:10
but this is just asking for a stab and
20:13
the Austrian at least this year hasn't
20:15
gained anything they've supported Turkey
20:17
into Romania sure but they've gained no
20:20
centrist it's only Turkey that benefits
20:21
from this move and Italy too is maybe
20:25
going to gain a center through occupying
20:27
Portugal or through occupying Spain um
20:30
so really it's the Austrian who's at a
20:32
loss here and a strong Italian and a
20:34
strong Turk is only bad for the Austrian
20:36
so I do believe that a stab from the
20:38
Austrian is coming this turn whether
20:40
that be in Venice or in Bulgaria and
20:42
it's just a matter of which is which
20:46
okay well swapping theaters how do you
20:49
plan to fight in the Scandinavian
20:51
countries
20:53
well as I mentioned previously the
20:55
German has I believe overstressed
20:56
themselves it is true they're on the
20:58
gates of Warsaw but I think at least I
21:01
hope I don't know anything anymore i
21:03
hope at least the German can listen to
21:05
my pleas that hey if you take Warsaw
21:08
we're taking KE so it only makes sense
21:09
that both of us take a step back and go
21:12
back to our respective regions and in
21:14
turn we both don't lose because if the
21:16
German was to take Warsaw I take Keel
21:18
and we both a center and that's bad for
21:20
both of us right it's um unnecessary
21:23
competition upon the board additionally
21:25
the German has been shorted by the
21:27
English player the English player
21:28
promised not to go to North Sea but now
21:30
they have so I think we have a natural
21:34
enemy that being the Englishman and I
21:36
believe that if the German supports me
21:38
from Baltic back into Sweden from
21:40
Denmark it's only good for the both of
21:42
us right so I believe that using the
21:46
Baltic Sea as my gambit I can ensure
21:49
that the German goes back to Berlin and
21:51
Munich and doesn't capitalize on a
21:52
Warsaw being wide open you place a lot
21:55
of importance at least I see in your
21:59
alliance with France but is that more an
22:03
alliance out of necessity that you have
22:06
created or something that you have
22:08
worked hard to find no it very much is
22:10
an alliance of necessity because at
22:13
least on last move the only individuals
22:16
not to move against us were the
22:18
Frenchmen the Italians abandoned Venice
22:20
and abandoned all notions of attacking
22:22
the Austrians the Turks moved against us
22:24
the Austrians moved against us obviously
22:26
the English moved against us and the
22:27
Germans moved against us it's not a fun
22:28
position um it was only the French who
22:31
are also shorted by the Germans so I
22:33
think uniting ourselves on that front of
22:35
both being um you know stabbed by the
22:38
Germans can be our uh common bond and it
22:43
is out of necessity but I do believe our
22:45
alliance with the Frenchmen could
22:46
flourish into a great one right france
22:50
and Russia when combined will spell the
22:51
doom for Germany and therefore our two
22:54
powers when united will force the
22:56
Germans into reconsidering their current
22:58
position
23:00
before the entire world turned against
23:03
you did you have any sinking feeling
23:06
that it was going to happen or was it a
23:08
complete shock i really did um and
23:10
that's why see the issue is um when I
23:14
was calculating this I knew that I
23:16
couldn't stop if Austria and Turkey were
23:18
to work together I couldn't stop them
23:20
from taking Romania anyways because
23:22
their units just can cut all support
23:24
right as they did too they didn't need
23:27
to cut all support i mean I was going to
23:28
support Turkey into Austria but even if
23:32
I were to defend perfectly it just
23:33
wouldn't be possible because the
23:34
Austrians or the Austrians and Turks
23:36
combined would be able to cut all my
23:38
support anyways and took Romania as it
23:40
is so that's why I kind of hoped that
23:42
the Turks would listen to me instead
23:44
that didn't happen and it is what it is
23:46
but I think now with Bulgaria wide open
23:48
it is possible to convince the Austrians
23:51
to take Bulgaria instead because that is
23:54
the easiest center for them to gain this
23:56
year if they do want to gain a center
24:00
do you think that constant growth is
24:04
more important or is there a value in
24:06
not growing at all for diplomatic
24:10
uh prevalence you know like
24:14
yeah that is a good point it is true
24:15
that there is a certain um beauty in not
24:18
having to grow because in doing so
24:20
you're not seen as a competitor as a
24:21
threat um I think the Italians are doing
24:24
that very well they're not growing very
24:26
much and therefore they're not seen as a
24:27
threat by the Austrians and that's
24:28
allowed the Austrians to turn a blind
24:31
eye on them and create an effective
24:33
relationship when you have too many
24:35
ambitious countries put together in a
24:37
coalition it just forces distrust and I
24:39
think that's part of the issue that we
24:41
did we tried to grow to too fast we flew
24:43
too close to the sun we gained too many
24:45
centers early on and that compelled the
24:48
Turks and the Austrians who were jealous
24:49
at only gaining one or two centers to
24:51
turn against us
24:53
but yeah I do think there is a certain
24:55
value you know not choosing not to grow
24:59
actively but then again you don't win by
25:02
not growing you win by ceasing centers
25:04
and especially early on I think it only
25:06
makes sense to take out some countries
25:09
initially and grab their center so
25:11
you're in a far better position to
25:12
negotiate in the future
25:17
ernest do you have anything i think
25:20
that's
25:20
it sink
25:24
okay so how about this if you were to
25:29
give one tip to another player uh of
25:33
your choice what would you say
25:36
one tip to another player of of my
25:38
choice how exciting
25:41
what would I tell them i mean truly I'm
25:44
not involved much in diplomatic talks
25:47
with other countries except for the
25:48
Balkan ones seeing as most have moved
25:51
against me um I would tell the
25:53
Englishmen to count their days because I
25:55
do think they're playing a dangerous
25:57
game right now with um towing the line
26:00
between allyship and just occupying
26:03
territories that go against what their
26:05
allies want specifically taking North
26:06
Sea despite the behest of their German
26:10
allies so uh I mean Englishman or
26:14
English woman in this case watch out i
26:16
suppose
26:19
yeah that's all i'm I'm out of questions
26:21
here awesome this is really fun this is
26:23
super fun thank you well one thing
26:25
that's particularly interesting is that
26:28
one thing that's particularly
26:29
interesting about your state of the
26:32
board down south near the Black Sea is
26:35
that you have a 4 to1 majority in
26:38
attacking um Romania romania mhm
26:43
that's very hard to manage to defend
26:46
Warsaw and Romania at the same time I
26:49
guess in my opinion how how will you do
26:52
that
26:54
so for Warsaw for Warsaw I'm totally
26:57
depending on trust over here this is all
26:58
trust and this probably isn't the best
27:00
of moves but I think that there's a
27:02
natural element of risk in diplomacy and
27:04
that if you don't play through that risk
27:05
you're going to be um driven over by
27:08
other players anyway so I'm trusting the
27:10
German will recoil back and go back to
27:13
their German center seeing the threat by
27:15
France france is now threatening Munich
27:17
and obviously we're threatening KE so I
27:19
think that those two uh cards will be
27:22
effective in persuading German to not
27:24
attack Warsaw and go back as for Romania
27:28
it's true we have a 4 to1 majority but
27:30
if Turkey does continue to work with
27:33
Austrian if the Austrians do continue to
27:34
work with the Turk it will mean they get
27:36
to maintain Romania and what I'm hoping
27:38
for is that if the Austrian gets greedy
27:40
they go for Bulgaria instead they cut
27:42
the Turk out and if they were to go for
27:44
Bulgaria that removes the support the
27:46
Turk needs to maintain Romania and then
27:48
we can force them out yet again so
27:51
that's my game plan right now just to
27:53
try to hope that the Austrians and Turks
27:56
will move against one another and maybe
27:58
it happens maybe it doesn't who knows
28:00
it's all very much a gamble
28:04
interesting
28:06
i think this was very interesting
28:08
talking to you
28:10
uh because you know it is it is kind of
28:13
for our own amusement how people view
28:15
the game and what they decide to do and
28:18
I think today you have provided a very
28:20
good snapshot into the minds of the
28:22
Russian players
28:24
well only one snapshot we have two other
28:26
Russians we do I think Samir would echo
28:30
my sentiments mi um Mji wasn't here on
28:33
Friday but I think she would too she did
28:35
mention how she did have a sneaking
28:36
suspicion about how all the players
28:38
would move against us and it turns out
28:40
she was correct sooner rise than later
28:42
so it is what it is
28:47
all right thank you for coming today
28:51
thank you Ernest this was fun and thank
28:53
you Ken obviously fun thank you so have
28:58
fun studying I guess i guess so goodbye
29:00
Ken goodbye bye have fun
