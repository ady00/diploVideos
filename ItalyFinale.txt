0:01
you said you needed to do something or
0:03
you said you couldn't do it for 30
0:04
minutes so we should probably get going
0:07
let us commence all right so this is
0:11
where we left off
0:13
and I have to say I say I have a lot of
0:16
questions about what's going through
0:19
your head here because right now you are
0:24
currently almost prevent almost stopping
0:27
your war with France now this is a long
0:30
time ago i do not blame you if you do
0:31
not remember but what were your main
0:33
thoughts
0:36
everyone else told us to stop being at
0:38
war with France and so we just thought
0:39
it might be
0:41
easier and this was us this was us
0:45
saying "We're at a stalemate with France
0:48
we don't want England to get any
0:49
stronger so we might as well pause on
0:52
them." Um and we told them they had to
0:55
move out first and so this was them
0:56
proving themselves and that they were
0:58
not going to do anything so
1:02
well
1:06
this was us seeing if we could also move
1:08
out i
1:10
see well do you believe that that was
1:12
the right choice in the end
1:20
um
1:21
well I think our end was cut a little
1:24
short so it's hard to tell i think
1:27
really in the end nothing came of Italy
1:29
nothing much nothing much came cuz our
1:32
plans were extremely long term and so it
1:35
it kind
1:37
of the it took so long the game ended
1:40
let's just put it that way um and so no
1:44
I I don't know i don't think so i I
1:47
don't know how we could have done better
1:48
except for going against Austria which I
1:50
think whatever that we didn't i'm fine
1:52
with not going against Austria if we
1:54
remembered to move in the f last few
1:56
rounds huh it might have helped us it
2:00
might have it you know it probably
2:02
didn't help that we just stayed the same
2:04
well on the topic of forgetting to
2:06
submit your orders I mean like right
2:10
here I guess nothing really changed here
2:12
for in the next move I'm guessing uh but
2:16
I think it's one of these other moves in
2:18
the future very close to now that you
2:20
forgot to Yeah right here you forgot to
2:23
submit orders right here and on the
2:25
topic of doing that what sort of do you
2:29
think kind
2:31
of I don't know spurred on this these
2:35
repeated incidents was it a discontinued
2:37
interest in the game or were you just
2:39
not satisfied with how you're doing no I
2:42
mean we were interested in the game i
2:45
think okay
2:48
actually there was a level
2:51
of being a little unsure of what was
2:54
happening like everyone else was kind of
2:56
doing stuff and half reaching
2:58
out
3:00
and also it was the end of senior year
3:03
and so we kept forgetting to submit
3:04
orders cuz the timing was weird and it
3:07
was like finals week or and so that it
3:10
was like shorter schedules and so we
3:11
kept forgetting to do things um so this
3:14
was not an intentional strategic move
3:17
per se
3:19
um right but we did in Yeah I have
3:22
nothing more to say we just kind of got
3:24
forgetful at the end and we were not
3:26
winning and we were also probably not
3:29
losing so we decided to just go with it
3:34
what are we going to do it's a tough
3:36
It's a tough
3:37
situation and yeah I've been in very
3:40
similar situations in the many diplomacy
3:42
games that I have played um I
3:47
even after the fact I wrote a poem about
3:50
it and sent it to everybody in the game
3:52
but
3:53
like basically I thought that I had set
3:58
out with high aspirations like I was
4:00
Alexander Hamilton from the hit uh
4:02
musical
4:03
Hamilton not going to waste his shot but
4:06
in the end maybe he did waste his shot
4:09
or something i don't know right like
4:10
yeah that's pretty much us i feel like
4:12
we came in with with high hopes and then
4:16
but also we knew the game was probably
4:18
either going to get postponed or ended
4:20
this week and so we kind of just we were
4:23
like oh I don't know man like if if it
4:25
ain't long term it's certainly not short
4:27
term
4:29
so oh my gosh no I get it I get it I
4:32
mean I would call that burnout and
4:34
that's not something unique to you guys
4:36
either a lot of other folks I believe
4:39
were firsthand
4:41
We're given the firsthand experience of
4:43
that
4:45
phenomenon
4:47
but let's say at at this time spring
4:53
1908 do you think that it was Russia or
4:56
England who was more likely to snag the
4:59
wind
5:02
russia
5:07
and why is that
5:10
i wondered if you might ask that um
5:16
um I think just because OB is so good at
5:21
manipulating and betraying
5:23
people and also France started to
5:26
actually figure out that they should go
5:28
against England and
5:30
so I thought that England might suffer
5:32
from that a little bit um and I also
5:35
yeah I did think Russia was going to be
5:36
able to strategically pull more off than
5:39
they were in this moment they were just
5:41
a strong player throughout the whole
5:43
game and so I kind of thought it was
5:44
Russia's
5:47
well now that you're now that you
5:48
comment on how you feel about the
5:50
Russian players what about France i
5:54
think it was a little I I'm not totally
5:56
sure why they
5:59
didn't make an extremely strong alliance
6:02
with Britain i actually the France just
6:04
got unlucky because we immediately went
6:06
against them and Britain is like so oh
6:09
we don't do long-term alliances and so
6:12
um I think France just got unlucky with
6:14
their neighbors and couldn't really do
6:17
much yeah but it also didn't help that
6:19
they were a little slimy scum in some
6:22
terms
6:24
so that's my thoughts well if if you're
6:27
faced with slimy scums you have to
6:29
become one i have to say that's that's
6:31
my that's my conclusion on that comment
6:34
good life lesson Kenan mhm you are who
6:37
you are who you are you are who you
6:40
surround yourselves with
6:43
i think you are who you are that's
6:44
that's a good one have you considered
6:47
like Yeah I know i I I know people say
6:49
that I should be a therapist i thought
6:51
you were trying to say you are what you
6:53
eat and I was like
6:54
well I Yeah in this game it is true uh
6:58
Russia ate Turkey and then he became
7:00
Turkey makes sense that's true makes
7:02
sense well okay we'll go with this
7:07
yeah all right
7:09
moving on you find you you actually move
7:12
against the Russians here yeah at this
7:14
point we wanted to take Russian
7:15
territory without betraying Austria and
7:18
then uh that was our plan and we thought
7:20
oh we'll just get more territory so that
7:22
when the time comes we can go against
7:23
Russia and France
7:26
let's just say the time did not come
7:31
very
7:33
sad but unfortunately I think Russia saw
7:37
your moves were coming
7:40
we should have done move earlier and not
7:41
held
7:43
hey well we'll never know there's a lot
7:46
you guys Italy is such an unfortunate
7:49
country cuz they're stuck between a rock
7:51
and a hard place and especially in your
7:54
case is in a different area
7:57
what isn't that in the Middle East
8:01
the Rock okay come on
8:05
i thought Okay all right you want to
8:08
know something i just No it was really
8:10
stupid cuz I my brain went somewhere
8:12
completely different you know Dwayne the
8:13
Rock Johnson the Rock Johnson i knew you
8:15
were going to say that
8:18
Samoa yeah i was I was No I was like
8:20
wait did he come from Turkey
8:23
i was like
8:26
but yeah as I was saying yeah Italy is
8:30
in a tough position italy is the worst
8:33
but also I think especially in your case
8:36
it was just really unfortunate cuz
8:38
there's many things that happened where
8:42
if things just went down slightly
8:44
differently you would have it could have
8:46
all been different don't blame me don't
8:49
blame me in particular yeah don't blame
8:50
me nothing in particular but whatever
8:53
i'll never forgive you if you did oh
8:55
come on come on i had my wisdom teeth
8:58
out look I I mean I I I'm sympathetic
9:02
for what happened to you but you have to
9:04
realize the orders went through and
9:07
France was already happy like it would
9:09
be like a
9:11
complete It'd be really really really
9:14
biased supposed to know the orders
9:17
before what let's This is not This
9:19
doesn't matter this is not an important
9:20
part of our friendship and we need to
9:22
move on
9:24
well okay i just I just hope you know
9:27
that it wasn't because I hate you or
9:29
anything but because I wanted to be
9:31
friends i know that's why i know that's
9:33
why i just disagree with the choice what
9:36
could And that's okay what could I have
9:38
i don't know what I could have done to
9:39
make both parties happy
9:42
well why did France know what our orders
9:45
were because because when when the
9:48
deadline happened 1 1:00 or Yes it was
9:52
1:00 I think or 1:30 that I texted that
9:56
Nathan spoke to me nathan spoke to me
9:59
through Why did France hear those orders
10:01
because after he spoke to me I posted
10:04
the map of all the What time
10:08
what do you mean okay wait a second have
10:10
you done your homework am I going to get
10:11
Was it 101 or was it 102 because as far
10:15
as I'm concerned France didn't see the
10:16
orders until 101 or 102 and if I
10:18
submitted my orders at
10:21
10 Wait no if France would have seen the
10:23
orders at
10:27
10.1 no I would have submitted the
10:29
orders at
10:30
10 which means France couldn't have seen
10:32
the orders before I sent them in do you
10:35
see where I'm going yeah but see this is
10:36
why it's not important i don't blame you
10:39
i don't think that you hate me i just
10:41
think you're wrong
10:44
okay well if we can move past it that'd
10:47
be great anyways
10:50
what do things do in Google Classroom
10:51
kenan
10:53
they always say
10:56
well they don't Right they say 12 a.m am
11:00
I Google Classroom Mac am I Google
11:04
Classroom you are Google you should You
11:06
should have been Google Classroom
11:09
yeah I should have been more specific
11:12
the path that was never was it's okay
11:14
that was my fault i should have been
11:16
more specific it's okay anyways not a
11:18
big deal i mean like I feel like another
11:23
thing that contributes to you like maybe
11:25
forgetting to turn in moves every once
11:27
in a while is you're not that involved
11:30
in other places of the map like
11:33
everywhere else tons of crap is
11:35
happening look at this central Europe
11:37
bull crap like what the hell is
11:39
happening there do you have anything to
11:41
comment on any of the events
11:43
internationally i won't lie I had no
11:46
idea what was happening and I don't
11:47
think Nathan did either we were That's
11:49
what I'm That's why we didn't we kind of
11:51
forgot is you and analyzed right is we
11:54
were a little bit clocked out by the end
11:55
of this we were just like "Oh we'll
11:57
we'll try to take some Russian
11:59
territories and we'll hold Pedmont."
12:05
Okay well that is unfortunate
12:10
but we could touch up on that a little
12:13
bit more when we get to the next move
12:15
set which I think is also you holding
12:17
all units maybe we definitely forgot
12:20
again no no not here not here well
12:24
actually the Russians the Russian
12:26
players they made a very funny comments
12:30
on this move set right here in my
12:32
interview with them um what was it uh
12:36
he's like "By the way the Italian orders
12:38
were not inputed correctly this was the
12:41
a very bad move set because you could
12:44
have moved Ionian into Eastern
12:45
Mediterranean instead of Aian into
12:47
Eastern Mediterranean and you would have
12:48
surrounded Smyrna and you could have
12:50
done something." Look I think okay maybe
12:54
I don't know if you want to include this
12:55
or not but this was the day that Nathan
12:57
submitted the orders and not me because
13:01
because I was busy and so I just told
13:04
him do whatever you want and honestly I
13:06
probably would have made the same
13:08
mistake yeah
13:12
just just what I have to say about this
13:14
move is yeah I mean we were lowkey
13:18
nonchalant
13:22
[Music]
13:26
yeah yeah play that music right here
13:28
okay this move was purposeful it's
13:31
lowkey a move good any continue i have
13:34
to go soon i'm so sorry um it's okay
13:38
never mind i was going to ask what you
13:40
were doing but we got We can't waste
13:41
time let's move we know we weren't doing
13:42
anything important well again did Nathan
13:47
turn in moves here
13:52
yeah well it's okay i would I would have
13:55
had EAS support Ionian into a GN
14:03
but the time is fast
14:07
oh
14:09
and oh man I do want to reach the end
14:12
because there are some final questions I
14:14
do want to ask you
14:16
um I'm confused why SMY tried moving to
14:20
Edinburgh
14:22
oh yeah you see Ove I mean you can watch
14:26
the video of his interview um but Ove
14:31
realized that Smyrna wasn't doing
14:33
anything and to just be funny he decided
14:35
to enter in an impossible move
14:38
order and make some line art on the map
14:41
that is hilarious
14:44
and who know he could he could have done
14:46
something way wilder he could have tried
14:48
like supporting an army in Edinburgh to
14:51
Moscow and it would just be just be
14:54
insane but here you move you held all
14:57
units really unfortunate
15:00
yeah we forgot
15:03
it's okay it's all fine and the final
15:06
move something interesting is happening
15:08
guys alert alert greece is being taken
15:10
by the Italians
15:13
i think wait let me go find our text
15:14
thread because I think they texted us
15:16
sorry this is like this is the biggest
15:18
betrayal let's see
15:19
us
15:24
a Oh no they didn't say
15:27
anything the last thing that happened
15:31
was Wait I swear they said something
15:34
somewhere or maybe they said it in real
15:36
life it might have been real life but
15:38
they were
15:39
like "How could you this is the biggest
15:42
betrayal and we're like we literally
15:43
wouldn't have done it unless the game
15:44
was ending like we just did this for for
15:47
for craps and giggles yes not Wait what
15:51
was the other word you were going to say
15:52
instead instead of craps nothing nothing
15:57
um well was this your decision or
16:01
Nathan's decision to take Greece it was
16:04
both of us we were just like should we
16:06
take Greece should we move all of Spain
16:10
let's move east to SMI like we were just
16:12
being crap like we were just being
16:13
stupid at this point for fun well that's
16:16
what diplomacy should be all about let's
16:18
be stupid for fun
16:21
see I was right though obey did win in
16:22
the end
16:25
mhm do you think that he deserved to win
16:28
yeah probably i mean long term if if we
16:31
had been playing a longer term game I
16:33
think me and Nathan still could have
16:35
done something a little better than this
16:37
but alas you must be live more in the
16:40
moment than we did
16:44
if you were to continue this game on
16:46
that note um what do you think you would
16:50
do what would be your take an SM con
16:54
tried to move against the Russians with
16:56
the um Austrian support and anic that
17:01
means building three armies or fleets
17:04
build armies and fleets start moving
17:06
back into France when they don't suspect
17:08
it and all their armies are up in Europe
17:09
or
17:10
Britain take France then Italian
17:13
domination higher into England yeah
17:16
eliminate France get higher into Russia
17:20
probably destroy the
17:21
Austrians um take over British territory
17:25
and win the game would have been my play
17:28
but alas the French players they managed
17:32
to get up to seven centers is this
17:34
something you expected or was it a bit
17:37
of a surprise i don't care about the
17:40
French i think I don't even know if I
17:44
like knew what was happening like
17:47
because by the end of it it was just
17:49
like me and Nathan were playing very
17:51
stupidly and so I didn't really expect
17:54
to do that well in the very end um did I
17:56
expect France to get seven centers i
17:58
don't know they started the seven
18:00
centers so maybe did I expect them to
18:01
get Edinburgh not really
18:04
is entertaining though
18:09
if you were to restart this game same
18:12
people same powers
18:14
controlled what would you do differently
18:16
and what would you do the same
18:19
team up with Russia and attack Austrian
18:23
that's actually interesting
18:25
i mean I wouldn't have because I liked I
18:28
liked and I wouldn't have changed how
18:29
this game went because I liked teaming
18:31
with Gabe and Seline
18:33
but strategically do I think we would
18:36
have won if we had done that it is more
18:40
likely second thing I would have done is
18:42
submit orders on time um third thing is
18:47
um yeah actually I don't know i think it
18:49
was an okay game even if we lost i think
18:52
this I mean I think it's one of the
18:55
greater games that I've seen i wish I
18:57
played in it cuz I would have loved to
18:59
yeah a lot of people were committed for
19:02
a long period of time and while that
19:04
commitment sort of waned a little bit
19:05
near the end there was still a decent
19:07
amount of it there so
19:10
it was fun so what was your Okay I'm
19:14
sorry if
19:15
I'm Okay I'm eating into your time a
19:18
little bit but what was your favorite
19:20
moment move or like taking more
19:26
amazing that was the move that was your
19:29
masterpiece it was it was my little
19:32
master
19:33
plan and then Nathan got cocky too and
19:36
he was like "Well we have Marseilles."
19:38
And I was like "Nathan shut up don't
19:41
give them any
19:43
ideas." Or it was like "We took Spain or
19:45
something." And he was like "Well we
19:46
have Spain." I was like "What are you
19:48
doing?"
19:51
But that was I will admit probably the
19:53
best moment when we took Marseilles it
19:54
was so
19:55
funny so funny
20:02
what
20:04
so okay my least favorite part was when
20:07
Ove spoke to me
20:09
damn poor Adve but actually not poor Ove
20:12
cuz he won
20:14
ove would not shut up and he would just
20:17
keep telling me things and I was like
20:19
"Ove the more you talk the less that I
20:22
want to leave with you." What about you
20:25
need to let Mickey huh what about him
20:28
made him talking made you want to team
20:30
up with him less i mean he is smart and
20:33
he has good strategies but sometimes I
20:35
would be like "Uh we'll have to think
20:38
about that." Or "Uh I'll get back to you
20:41
later." And he'd be like "Oh that's
20:42
great that's great but just consider
20:45
that this is the and you're going to do
20:46
it." And then he'd just keep going and I
20:48
was like "A I need a minute to think."
20:50
Or like be a I'm not doing it and then
20:52
he keeps trying to convince me and I was
20:54
like "A you don't understand oh I don't
20:57
blame him cuz that is the name of the
20:59
game that's true i don't blame him
21:02
either but let's just say his convincing
21:05
did not work it worked for most folks it
21:08
It was like It was like he and Austria
21:10
were in an abusive relationship that I
21:13
don't know why Austria kept going back
21:14
to him he kept lying ridiculous
21:20
well would you characterize this
21:22
experience as generally a fun one of
21:25
course it was a grand time well I'm glad
21:29
i I'm so sorry that you had to suffer
21:32
the entire game basically
21:35
the second we got Italy I was like "Oh
21:37
it's cooked." We have to play over the
21:38
summer sometime i do want to play over
21:40
this summer in fact I'd love to try and
21:42
do Weeble round two if people are up for
21:45
it i would not it would have to be in
21:47
person though i don't I don't know if I
21:48
could do this
21:51
yeah it takes so much out of your daily
21:54
life that is that is another thing how
21:58
how did that how did you feel about that
21:59
and how much time did it take up
22:03
lots of time it was like we would call
22:06
outside or we would text outside of like
22:09
school or meet up at lunch and I would
22:11
be like these people aren't
22:13
listening so yeah it just took up my
22:16
brain space and so I guess by the end of
22:18
it it I had a senioritis b was so burnt
22:22
out from just like this the high school
22:24
experience and then
22:28
d it just people were not
22:31
like
22:34
that willing to do certain things and so
22:38
I guess by the end of it it was like oh
22:39
my
22:40
goodness I'm very tired i mean I don't I
22:44
I hate using the word
22:47
but you had essentially correct me if
22:50
I'm wrong given up
22:54
yeah not given up just Yeah okay well
22:57
not like given up completely because we
22:58
still had a plan but we we knew it
23:00
wasn't likely to come to fruition and so
23:02
we kind of accepted that we might not
23:05
succeed
23:07
yeah it's always It's always unfortunate
23:09
when it gets to that point and but if we
23:12
if we'd kept going and I'd regained
23:14
strength throughout the summer maybe the
23:17
other I mean I always I understand your
23:21
position cuz I have I have been the
23:24
recipient of these emotions
23:28
myself and it's very easy to just lose
23:32
interest and to focus on other things
23:35
and I don't blame you for doing that
23:36
that's a perfectly natural thing i will
23:38
say we were still trying we were we were
23:40
trying to switch up our strategy and
23:42
succeed by going into Russian territory
23:46
but it was a little too late to fully
23:48
enact
23:50
yeah it's just I try not to do it myself
23:53
nowadays
23:55
because I feel like it makes everybody
23:59
else's experience less meaningful like
24:03
they're trying to talk to someone and
24:05
they're just clearly not interested
24:08
but it's it's whatever really we still
24:12
talk to people and we're still
24:13
interested
24:15
we we were making our deal with France
24:16
we were moving away from France and we
24:18
were actively telling Russia that we
24:22
weren't going to make a deal with them
24:23
and you know it wasn't like we just
24:25
completely clocked out of the game
24:27
that's true or like went blank or AFK
24:29
even we just you know were a little
24:31
slower than others and didn't succeed as
24:33
much here's a fun fact Mac while you
24:36
might feel that you struggled the entire
24:37
game you can have salts in the fact that
24:39
you were fourth out of seven people just
24:42
saying seven countries oh that's we were
24:45
fourth oh my god you're right austria
24:48
got less than us
24:50
so hey that's crazy it is quite
24:54
crazy i said crazy that's crazy
24:59
well and it's only because we took
25:01
Greece at the end
25:05
otherwise they would have beat us
25:09
if we had moved in that hold and took
25:10
Spain that would have been funny we
25:12
should have done that the
25:19
god
25:21
i wonder if you were to play this again
25:25
how long do you have to wait until
25:27
you're down to play
25:28
again or would you get up right back
25:31
again i'd play again i'd give it another
25:33
go i wouldn't do it online it takes too
25:35
much
25:36
it takes too much out of me to play
25:39
it long term at least it does right now
25:43
and I need a break before college
25:45
because I put a lot into school yes of
25:47
course i I do not blame you i need a
25:50
break myself so I'm glad that this is
25:52
the last interview and that we're
25:54
getting it out of the way but before but
25:56
I would play again well before we end it
25:58
off though do you have any questions for
26:00
me
26:02

26:04
dreamed

26:09

26:13
moments it's I'm I am more glad that

27:34
say put this in the video Ken in the
27:37
beginning of the game we had high
27:39
hopes we had We had hopes wait restart
27:44
don't put that in the video i'm putting
27:46
that part in the video
27:49
in the beginning of the game we had high
27:51
hopes we had dreams plans aspirations
27:55
you might call them
27:57
although in the beginning we did also
28:00
admit that we might fail and fell
28:03
short so even though we were cocky and
28:05
had confidence in the
28:07
beginning and even though we fail and
28:10
fall short now we still saw it
