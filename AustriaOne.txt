0:00
is Selene getting on soon Uh oh Speak of the devil There she is
0:08
Guys I'm so sorry I literally I was sleeping It's fine It's fine Okay Sorry Why don't
0:17
we just uh jump straight into it then Uh so coming into this like I know you guys
0:23
were new but did you have like any initial plans or an initial strategy that you guys thought you would like
0:29
adhere to coming into this game Well because we're new uh we went ahead
0:36
and started off with like you know internet searches of what to do kind of
0:42
like as beginners And I think our initial strategy was to try to be
0:48
aggressive with our moves but not like violent like be perceived as violent So
0:55
like be assertive but not be perceived as a threat
1:01
Mhm We want to We knew that like Austria was in a precarious position and that if
1:06
we didn't make allies quick we could easily be attacked from all sides So we
1:12
knew that it was going to be really valuable to make and maintain good
1:18
allies Are we like what are what are going to be done with these videos Are they going to be
1:24
shown to everybody Yeah I'll show Yeah this is going to be shown to everybody at the end Okay At the end or like Yeah
1:30
right now Well not right now At the end of the game so you could feel free to say anything you want Be 100% truthful
1:36
Great plans Okay Okay So as of now we have a really strong alliance with Italy
1:42
um and a pretty strong alliance with Turkey And we knew that we wanted to do that We were going to plan on definitely
1:48
allying with Italy Um one because they're right next to us and two because it's Nathan and I kind of trusted them
1:55
already And then we were trying to decide if we were going to go ally ourselves with Turkey or Russia cuz we
2:02
figured the more allies the better And as soon as Abe started talking that convinced us to ally with Turkey instead
2:08
So Oh why Oh what what was it about Abe that made you really want to go against him I could just tell he's a really good
2:14
speaker but I could just tell that he was speaking 100% for his own benefit You know what I mean Like he's really
2:21
convincing and persuasive and I found myself almost convinced and persuaded
2:27
but um I knew that they were more dangerous to us I knew that Augbe had
2:33
played the game before many times and he had come with a vengeance and he really wanted to win So I was wary of him I I
2:41
also felt like he was trying to blind us with like a veil of ignorance He was like coming up to us using these you
2:48
know using these embellished words and I was like "Okay he's trying to trick us
2:54
right now." That's hard as hell A veil of ignorance That's so and we knew that
2:59
like he was we he kind of gave it away a little bit because obviously he's smart but I think he knows he's really smart
3:07
So he would like be going around and like tell one person one thing Uh they'd
3:12
be like they'd go to Turkey and be like oh you know we can uh we'll we'll push into Serbia if you help us out And then
3:19
they'd come to us and be like hey you know uh you should push into the Turkish territory you know And then it was like
3:25
clearly clearly he wasn't actually trying to help us Sorry if you're watching this now Clearly he wasn't
3:30
trying to help us and he was just in it Was like he was like trying to he was trying to become the puppet master Yeah
3:35
I respect it I know he's really good at it but we weren't going to fall for it and we knew an ally with Russia is just
3:43
an enemy in disguise So man so many hard quotes All right So
3:49
like that was like generally what you thought you were going to do coming into this game but what about long-term
3:56
strategy Where do you see yourself in the future And what do you think you will need to do in the future in order to successfully gain the 18 centers you
4:02
need to win H I think one thing that we're really gunning for in the future is trying to
4:11
keep this image of like being the least hated Um so I think like one thing
4:17
that's really important in this game is like obviously how you're perceived by all of the other countries And I think
4:24
right now people are kind of seeing our allyship against Russia but I don't
4:30
think that they're necessarily like seeing us as the biggest threat on the board Like as we could as we could see
4:37
from the last round like we perceived Russia and like France to be the biggest threats So we all kind of like went
4:43
after them and then it kind of worked out in our favor because those two were the most visible So I think like in the
4:50
future rounds it's kind of about keeping our heads down but like dominating quietly We always want to be like second
4:58
best you know So like we're never like the main threat that everybody's after but we're also never like the small one
5:04
that's like falling apart And I think the way we're going to do that is with this secret alliance we have called it
5:12
the European Allied Treaty Organization which is between uh us Italy and Turkey
5:19
And at first it was just us and Italy but we decided to add Turkey in a push against Russia And it's pretty much the
5:25
three of us vowing to one not attack each other and two when it's beneficial to both of us help each other out with
5:32
attacks like we just did with Turkey on Russia Um and the long-term plan for that is
5:40
we'll be we want to be like like saying the least hated and kind of like the heroes We don't want to be the bullies
5:45
We want to be standing up to the bullies so that implicitly everybody trusts us and we just keep growing But then by the
5:51
time they know it we're too big to be stopped We already got rid of the big bullies and then we kind of extinguish
5:57
everybody else and then ideally it would be a fair fight between us three But I
6:02
think we all three of us understand obviously only one of us can win But it's in all of our favors to get the
6:09
number of opponents down from six to two So that's our plan The three of us hopefully we don't backstab each other I
6:15
have no intention of doing that now Obviously there will come a time but we'll cross that bridge when we get to
6:21
it That's the plan Okay Well on that note you've you seem to have formed this
6:27
alliance with Turkey and Italy Um what what do you think when do you
6:33
think you should betray them and how will you betray them
6:40
Um yeah I think we've begun to talk about this a little bit because like the
6:46
good part of an alliance is that you have backup when you need it but also the bad part is that you have to back them up You know like you have to keep
6:53
your word or else you're going to lose that trust in like the alliance And so I think like the point at which we start
7:00
backstabbing is when I feel like when the benefit of stabbing them is greater
7:06
than if um helping helping them like right now it's more beneficial for us to
7:12
help them because it's it's there's enemies more enemies than friends But I think that once we get to the point
7:18
where there's more friends than enemies we become enemy secretly
7:24
And for the second part of your question of how we're going to do it I think what
7:29
we just did with Russia is kind of the model that we're we want to follow for future times because we were telling
7:36
this was the first time where we outright lied to Russia because before in previous rounds we were telling them like oh we're going to step into Serbia
7:43
or Bulgaria or whatever and we did so we were telling the truth but this was the first time we were we explicitly said
7:50
we're going to go for Italy which meant and they thought we were vulnerable but actually we supported Turkey into going
7:55
straight into them And clearly Audrey was like distraught by that because he was texting us and texting Turkey about
8:02
that But um we still are being diplomatic with them don't really want
8:08
to be like declaring allout war and like everybody kill Russia you know like we
8:13
don't want to be like mean because that's again that's the image we're trying to project is like being like the
8:19
hero standing up to the bully that everybody likes and not the actual bully themselves So I think the only time
8:26
where we would have like an aggressive I guess breakup like that would be if there's only two left like
8:32
if it's just us in Italy and there's nobody else to be on our side then we might as well declare full war But as
8:40
long as there are other people we want to be even if we're backstabbing we want to do it as politely as possible So you
8:48
did mention how you kind of wanted to be the heroes the second best in that way
8:53
like appearing hidden but do you think that anybody else would do this And if
8:58
so who would be that and thus be the most underestimated player and why
9:05
H okay I think at this point it could be
9:10
one of our two there I think both of them are in a very good position strategically to do the same thing that
9:17
we're doing Um especially I think especially Turkey to be honest cuz I
9:24
think nobody really expects them to like um be like the dominant force just
9:29
because they they're vulnerable just by looking at them on the map you know and just just by nature of where they're
9:35
positioned I feel like people already think that they're vulnerable which is true to an extent but if they were to
9:42
backstab like us or Italy they could become like a really strong force And I
9:49
think because they got they got those two Juva and Bogya I think both of them are very diplomatic in a way that could
9:56
fool people and strategic Yeah And catch them off guard I actually want to I am going to say I
10:04
think England might be the underdog here Obviously right now they're a little bit down They are currently the smallest But
10:13
here's the thing the as we know the world order right now is dominated by France and Russia And both France and
10:19
Russia were the biggest threats to England It looks like their England is fine with Germany but England did get
10:27
backstabbed by France But we can see that obviously we're mounting the retreat on Russia and England made a
10:34
successful push towards Russia's controlled Sweden Um which I think is a good sign of England's expansion and we
10:42
know now that Italy is planning to um attack France on both sides which would
10:49
mean that England also has the upper hand in terms of attacking France So I think if all goes according to plan for
10:56
us the plan is to attack Russia and
11:01
France like overtly shrink them down I'm praying and hoping that Germany will
11:07
just get smothered out and then I think our underdog will be England if not the
11:13
people in our alliance Well you did kind of mention that oh Russia and France
11:19
they're the big bads right now They're the ones with the most power But is that really true When the entire world has
11:24
decided to check them who now is the most powerful the big bad the greatest
11:30
power on the board like physically present H well I haven't really looked at the
11:39
map but I suppose like the I don't I'm looking at the map right now Um England
11:46
and Italy and Turkey have four territories We and Germany have five
11:51
France and Russia still have six So in terms of pure territory it still is France and Russia but they are on the
11:58
retreat I think it's going to be hard especially Russia being attacked on three different fronts at once Going to
12:04
be hard for them to hold their ground I would say right now I think Germany is
12:09
pretty strong because they have the same amount of troops as us but I think their position is less vulnerable than ours
12:16
Honestly I would say Germany And I think I think it is easy or not easy but like
12:22
it is better for us to have Germany right there with us because it's easier
12:29
for us to pin it on them and make them look like the enemy especially because we already have two other countries on
12:34
our side If we create a narrative it'll be much easier for us to push that narrative that Germany is the the new
12:40
big bad than for us to become the new enemy Do you think that that is the most
12:46
important thing for you to move forward Maybe perhaps that's the best diplomatic choice for you But what about
12:52
strategically like where are you going to get your 18 centers if you are going to win What's the best step moving
12:58
forward Our plan right now between our treaty is basically Turkey move up into
13:06
Russian space Italy move west into French space and then ideally we would
13:14
soon take Galatia um soon start taking like Warsaw and stuff like that I think
13:21
we want to pretty much create like we want to expand upwards So take a little
13:26
bit of what Russia has now but mostly expand towards like Germany England
13:33
territories um while Italy gets the west and Turkey gets the east and then if it comes down
13:39
to those three and obviously by then we won't have enough territories So hopefully our plan is if it's just
13:46
between us three we'll fight I think since our allyship with Italy is
13:53
stronger I think we would mount an attack against Turkey So we would move
13:58
east eastward and pretty much try to dominate the entire eastern half of the map from like Germany and Austria all
14:06
the way to Russia and Turkey Ernest do you have any questions
14:11
Um mostly like game specific questions
14:17
Um let's let's talk about your ally Italy for a second What is the likelihood that you think Italy will
14:24
stab you At this point I don't think it's very
14:29
likely Um especially in the next coming round I think it would be tackless for
14:35
them to attack us because I it's like we mentioned before there's more benefits
14:42
for them personally to than to hurt us at this um if they're
14:48
trying to get like the upper west side which is kind of what their plan is
14:54
right now according to them Um and I think that plan is most useful for them
15:00
and it would be kind of stupid for them to come come after us when you know we're trying to get the other side of
15:06
the like the map So why would they come way when they have this whole other side
15:12
that they can go for It's much simpler for them to get Yeah And especially because they're trying to reach France right now and they still have to most of
15:19
their troops and fleets are like kind of far from that So they'll take another round or two I think to reach there Um
15:26
so if all of a sudden they started attacking us right now that would be really stupid of them because they're spread out and stratified right now They
15:32
don't have that much force We could easily beat them if they were trying to attack us from there and that would mean
15:40
that their attack that they've been building up to would be like totally useless
15:46
Um so yeah even regardless of what we're saying to each other I just think it
15:52
would be flat out stupid for them to do that and they're smarter than doing that at least right now Well that naturally
15:58
leads to the next question of what about your ally Turkey What are your thoughts on them and whether or not they have the
16:04
audacity to stab you The audacity I think
16:11
is higher than than Italy just because of their position right now Although
16:16
they have we have helped them with Romania there is a chance that they become greedy and come after us more
16:24
Maybe go for Budapest or Serbia or or Greece or somewhere like that Um because
16:29
we did have a little bit of like a a not a scuffle but just like a a discussion Mild disagreement Yeah agreement
16:36
beforehand before this round about how um Turkey wanted to get Greece because
16:41
they wanted to have the coastal region so they could expand um westward Um but then Italy was saying that that doesn't
16:48
work for them because they're expanding the same exact route And so if Turkey was going that way they wouldn't be able
16:54
to expand because Italy would be there And so they were kind of um I think a
17:00
little bit takenback by like not being able to get like the coastal part And so like I think in some ways in later
17:07
rounds they could start going for that because they see it as a threat to just have this one sliver of the the map to
17:15
like expand out of Mhm Yeah Um I agree I think right now it would not be
17:20
strategic for them because they're by far the most vulnerable to Russia They
17:26
were under the loom and we are the ones who helped pull them out So if they immediately backstab us then they're
17:32
going to have two big enemies right in front of their face Um and I think I was
17:38
honestly I wasn't like scared of this but in the back of my head I was like what if we're like tricking Abe but
17:44
actually he's tricking us And actually actually he formed an alliance with Turkey and Italy and then all three of
17:51
them were going to close in on us at once And I was a little bit scared of that but it ended up not happening So I definitely trust Turkey more now than I
17:59
did before Still not as much as Italy because Italy they reached out to us right away We we were like on
18:05
immediately before they even reached out to us we were like we want to ally with Italy We trust them um the most But I
18:13
think right now personally my trust in Turkey is also pretty strong
18:18
So it's smooth sailing I guess But I guess yeah I mean like it seems but like
18:25
when you are at your highest I would also say that you could also be at your lowest and just not know it and you did
18:32
touch upon that point like oh no what if everyone's trying to attack us slowly But do you ever think that feeling of
18:39
war Yeah Do you ever think that feeling will go away the more you trust Or will that always be a looming presence
18:45
something that you have to think about whenever you look at the board of diplomacy Yeah Yeah No that's I think
18:53
fear is the name of the game here Diplomacy is all about the psychological
18:58
warfare you know I don't think it'll ever go away Maybe lessen But I think
19:04
that's the fun of it though Like the more risk there is the more the more reward there is So I think as the game
19:11
progresses and there become there more risk kind of like comes to light it'll
19:17
more fun and like I think the second that we stop worrying
19:22
about other people attacking us is when we die because then that's when people attack us with their guard down right so
19:28
I do want to the other part of me wanting to always be like second is
19:34
because I think if we're number one just just by the nature of the game it'll like get to our heads and be like
19:40
"Oh we're we're on top of the world We own this." And then we get confident and we get too cocky and then that's how you
19:47
know we get smashed So I definitely if if we ever stop feeling like this I feel
19:54
I think something has gone severely wrong And yeah is okay This might be one
20:00
to this might be one of our last questions But you see you have this huge aggressive force this huge aggressive
20:07
like like uh I don't know this push against Russia and France with uh the
20:12
changing board state how people can become stronger and all that stuff Is there a scenario where you might turn
20:19
coat where you might become allies with Russia that you see in the future that it might become beneficial for you to
20:26
start working with them Okay Yeah I mean I don't I don't think we're exactly like
20:32
completely opposed and closed off to all relations with Russia Like even earlier today after we basically like spit an
20:40
odd base face by moving with our move He was like "Well played." But you know
20:46
there's always you know room for us to keep negotiating And then we I think I think he's being smart about that Yes
20:52
And we didn't slap him in the face We're like "Hell no." We were like "Yeah yeah we'll you know we'll keep our eyes open
20:58
We'll keep our you know you know our relations are still open We're not closed off to it And I think that at
21:05
some point if it becomes more beneficial for us to ally with Russia it is a
21:11
possibility I don't think we're like closed off to it But frankly I don't really see that happening because right
21:17
now our plan is to push Russia make them as small as possible So if some weird
21:26
turn of events happens where like Turkey overextends and then Germany starts
21:33
punishing Turkey and then make Turkey weak and at the same time Russia capitalizes on that and they grow back
21:38
again and then suddenly it's US and Russia and Germany are the big ones and
21:44
Turkeykey's the small one who's just trying to poke at us and the only way to get rid of them is if we team up then
21:50
sure But like I feel like that's quite unrealistic but I feel like the fun of
21:55
the game is not knowing what's gonna happen So yeah like Selene said maybe
22:00
we're we don't want to burn any bridges yet So while we're going around we've talked about Italy we've talked about
22:06
Turkey we've talked about Russia and you have briefly mentioned Germany in your plans how you eventually want to take
22:13
them over but right now is are they a friend or are they a foe
22:18
Hm Honestly we haven't really talked to Germany that much Not at all Yeah We
22:23
haven't really like sat down and been like "Hey this is what we're doing." Like literally not once And I think part
22:28
of that is was our like subconsciously us focusing on Russia and like try to
22:34
get them out of the way first But I think I think it would be very useful to start talking to Germany and try to at
22:41
least get a sense of where they're at because I think right now they're doing a great job of kind of staying under the
22:48
radar and like expanding slowly and quietly maybe even better than we are
22:53
because I have no idea what's going on with them and they have not really
22:59
expressed any alliance but no like disalliance with anybody which like is
23:05
is very like mysterious about them and I think that's their strong suit right now Yeah I've heard Inklings I think that
23:13
they're allied with England against France I do definitely feel like currently in this early game there's two
23:19
wars going on right There's the southern war kind of of like Turkey Austria
23:24
Russia a little bit of Italy and then there's the northern war like England Germany and France And there's like two
23:30
distinct things going on Um obviously it's going to change soon but I think
23:35
I'm looking just at the map right now just in terms of tactics Germany does it's interesting
23:42
because they have a good amount of territory They have a good amount of armies but their position is a little
23:49
bit weird to me Like it doesn't really make sense because they have like a big empty space in the middle and then all
23:54
around are like little bits of armies So it doesn't really make sense I feel like it's a good it's good for defense
24:01
because they're protected on all sides but it's not really good for attacking because whichever way they choose to go
24:07
they don't have like one solid front that they can attack with all of them It'll have to be like only one or two
24:12
armies sticking out because the other ones are so far away So I don't know maybe we can take advantage of that
24:19
either take advantage of a strong defense that is pretty much like a wall
24:25
or if they start attacking we can just like you know snatch that and hopefully
24:33
so keep them get them while we get them while they're down So well sorry if I
24:39
could allow me to interject You can go ahead Well one thing that's if okay we
24:45
talked about Germany we talked about Italy and Turkey and Russia One thing that's very important as an Austria
24:51
player as any of the bottom three nations is control of the milit
24:57
Mediterranean What do you think will be the future state of the Mediterranean and what do you think is most important moving forward
25:05
It's going to come down to how the alliance plays out because I think the plan right now
25:12
is honestly not to worry too much about the Mediterranean because we have a hopefully strong alliance with Italy and
25:19
Turkey The plan is to just pretty much this was the plan and still is like
25:25
expand safely how we can so everybody takes what they can and we you know draw
25:31
clean borders that we're not going to fight over and then once we have that solid base we can all expand outwards a
25:37
lot more safely So since that base is like right there in the Mediterranean we don't really see a point in any of us
25:44
bickering about that right now I think if all goes to plan the only time we'd be fighting in like the sea or like
25:51
Greece or Naples or whatever is if we
25:57
um if somebody backstabs us if we have to backstab somebody or if it comes down
26:02
to the three of us and then we need to start fighting for territory Mhm I also want to say like obviously as
26:10
a first time players we're not super wellversed with the strategy Maybe we're underestimating the
26:16
importance of control in the Mediterranean Well I mean we should look into I talk about it less in a strategic
26:21
sense and more in a diplomatic sense How will you negotiate your territory
26:28
um in the sea in the one sea province that you can access for most of the
26:33
early game Yeah I think right now like it is kind of us relinquishing a little
26:39
bit of that power because we know that um um our coastal region that we have
26:46
right now TRRI is like a really like central port that you can you know like
26:52
um expend a lot of fleets from and it can be very powerful But right now we're
26:58
kind of holding that back because because of our alliance with Italy we're giving them like that kind of space to
27:03
go with their fleets um around like that that sea area Um although we do have Greece which is another like strong
27:09
coastal like area but I think right now we're we're prioritizing our alliance
27:16
over the control of the sea And I think if it comes down to it we would go to
27:24
like the lengths against Italy to get it but I think right now it's not a priority And I think since we um struck
27:32
the deal with Turkey for them to go through Russia fingers crossed we get to keep Greece dominated for a while Um as
27:41
long as Italy doesn't backstab us we'll get to keep try So we have two strong ports I think the fact that we put an
27:47
army there shows that we're not too concerned about oceanic warfare right now but hopefully our plan has set us up
27:54
in a way that we get to keep our really crucial um water access
28:00
So you did mention like one question ago a couple questions ago how Germany is
28:06
all spread out Their position is a little bit weird It's a and they Oh
28:12
Gabriel has left the meeting by accident
28:18
What happened man All right I accidentally left I was trying to show you guys this This is what I mean You
28:23
see it's like Yeah polka doted all around and that is like unprotected So
28:28
you I'm I'm interested in how you mentioned that because you did mention earlier how you wanted to eventually
28:34
capture Warsaw for yourself Does Germany having two armies adjacent to that
28:39
territory mess up your plans at all how that how they are almost going for Warsaw themselves before you have the
28:46
opportunity to do it Yeah that's the thing I think right now since we're in the war with Russia our first plan of
28:53
attack is going to be Galatia Um honestly I'm hoping that they go for
28:59
Warsaw right now because that would mean that Russia loses a home base and they don't get to generate more armies Am I
29:05
is that correct about the rules Yeah they can generate they can't generate armies in ones that they don't own Okay
29:11
So yeah Honestly I hope right now in the early game that Germany does go for and
29:17
capture Warsaw because that would help uh hurt our enemy more and the enemy of my enemy is my friend That would mean we
29:24
get to take Galatia they get to take the Black Sea this Ukraine and then I mean
29:30
that would be that would be kind of awesome honestly And hopefully what that actually means is that since they
29:36
overextend here that would leave this a little bit more vulnerable And then we
29:41
don't necessarily have to go for Warsaw All we have to do is just like find more stuff to take And then if they get here
29:47
we get strong they overextend we can just right into the heart
29:52
All right That's what I'm thinking Sounds good I although I will say I have not we have not been thinking very much
29:58
about our German expansion plans Well I'm glad that I got you thinking This is
30:03
a very important part Yep Sorry one more thing I think it's it is it is I think I'm realizing now that
30:11
it could make us vulnerable that we're focusing so much on the east side because I see now that we could be
30:17
perceived as a little bit vulnerable coming from this side because we're so focused on the Russian side So I think
30:23
we should keep our eyes open for that Yeah I think this is a strong wall Yeah it is Germany has no troops that touch
30:30
us They have one home base here but they still have territories in between And these are both our home bases which
30:36
means that they'll constantly be replenishing troops So I'm really not that worried And I don't think it's in
30:42
Germany's interest right now I think they're more worried about this All right Well that's all the questions
30:49
I have unless Ernest has some more I think we've touched base on all of the
30:55
um relevant stuff that well I think we prepared for I think you guys did really great in answering these questions I
31:00
think you're very in-depth and I like the um I like how you guys actually build on
31:07
off of each other It feels like it's almost like they were in a unit together I I wonder where I learned how to do
31:13
