0:00
okay So when you were coming into this game did
0:05
you guys have an initial plan or strategy that you were going to adhere to and what was it
0:13
I did not because I didn't know what was going on and I didn't know that there were specific strategies Well it makes
0:18
sense like looking at the map but there are specific strategies that each country should come up with and things
0:25
like that So I didn't really have any idea of what was going on in the beginning but I think McKenna has played
0:30
as Italy before So I I haven't played as Italy before However I have played as France and I know that France can get
0:37
extremely powerful extremely fast especially because when I played I just teamed with Britain and like took out
0:45
Germany quite fast and was like and also France immediately gets essentially you know two free spots So as now Italy
0:54
which is seemingly the more like disadvantaged in relation to France I
0:59
saw it as like kind of crucial to like get into France's face and like territory Um and it worked out because
1:06
um Austria was extremely willing to ally and trusted us
1:12
Unfortunately we didn't talk to Britain and Germany fast enough and so France initially got like two territories
1:19
actually three new ones which like gave him a big advantage But I think that everyone is seeing why I have been
1:25
saying this the whole time All right So essentially it was
1:30
anti-French the entire time Um once once French once the French are gone what do
1:37
you see yourself doing after that What is the next plan and strategy that you want to do
1:44
We haven't talked about this yet Yes I think I think it depends on how it plays
1:51
out with other areas Like ultimately if Austria and Turkey are still like going
1:57
strong against Russia I'm fully fine to let that play out before like moving in there at all Mhm I think if things work
2:04
out then I'd be willing to team with either Germany or Britain whichever one is stronger and to take out like the
2:10
weakest link Um I just also I think I need to leave I think we need to leave
2:16
enough people alive to take out Russia before we have to deal with it because
2:22
Adve seems to know what he's doing and also seems extremely slimy and so I'd
2:28
like to let other people deal with it before we have to Yeah we're currently very focused on attacking France right
2:33
now Like many of our fleets are positioned less left of the country and
2:38
we have Venice completely open But that's because we have formed a treaty organization with Turkey and Austria
2:47
It's called Ido Ido Yeah But basically we are all very so far very united And I
2:54
think that I have enough I think they're too invested in Russia to worry so far
3:01
about taking over our country So but once we get like resources from France
3:07
and from Spain and Portugal I think we need to reposition like back towards the mainland and fight like both upwards
3:16
towards like um I was going to say Brexit that's not exit So
3:22
like towards like the northern portion of France but also fortify our eastern
3:28
front Yeah cuz like right now we're in the middle of three different countries if not like you know at least like
3:34
Russia has like a border with that's like the end of the game So we just need to get like somewhere and then we can
3:41
branch out We were thinking like Portugal and Spain and we also have two fleets So that's like our second
3:46
headquarters So if we were to have the mainland being like taken over then we
3:53
have somewhere else to survive So you mentioned this alliance with Austria and
3:58
Turkey Um do you think that your place in it is more advantageous than your
4:05
allies place in it Like do you gain more out of the alliance than your allies
4:12
I think we've been a very passive member of this organization but I think we have like benefited a lot from it because we
4:19
don't have to worry about our eastern front I think like they've they are very focused on attacking Russia and we're
4:25
kind of out of the equation and we can't really help with that fight but just that that like treaty allows us to not
4:32
worry about them and takes away like part of the like the second guessing the alliances and things like that So I
4:37
would agree I think ultimately Italy and Austria probably benefit a little bit more because our mutually assured peace
4:45
has enabled us to treat our border as like a safe space Um Turkeyy's probably has like the
4:52
lowest right now because it it Russia's kind of like coming in on them but I firmly believe that it if Turkey sticks
4:58
with in this next play that it will like ultimately benefit them more than Russia
5:05
in the end So that statement that you made at the
5:10
end there Mac does that mean that you are suspicious that Turkey won't adhere to their word and that they will instead
5:16
move into Austria I um talked to
5:21
Turkey Well okay I sent Turkey four very long paragraphs explaining everything that could possibly happen with this
5:27
move And well okay I said the the good side of like Ido what could happen in a
5:33
win scenario because I genuinely I genuinely believe that if Russia like I
5:39
genuinely believe Russia is still at a disadvantaged position in this point It just looks like they're stronger and
5:46
ultimately it would benefit Turkey to not team with Austria but after this or to not team with Russia But after the
5:52
last move Baguia came up to me and was like "Um we need to talk about like what
5:58
Russia is doing." So I'm not totally sure He hasn't gotten back to me so I'm a little scared but I just think it
6:05
would be dumb to like to go with Russia cuz he can still win He I don't know
6:11
That's my personal thoughts in a genuine way Yes it benefits me but also I think it's a bad idea to let Russia go
6:17
unchecked I also want to touch up upon something Nathan said to the previous question not the one I just asked how
6:24
you how you said that your part in the alliance is more passive Do you think
6:29
that this will allow Austria and Turkeykey's relationship to improve better and thus you would be the odd man
6:36
out out of the three of you if you guys did manage to conquer the world together
6:41
I don't think so because I think like the the the contested territory is Russia and I think that like while they
6:48
have a common goal of trying to take over Russia's territory that like
6:53
decision to how like on how to split up the territories will create conflict while we don't have like we don't have
7:00
like something that like we want to share or anything like that like our interest is elsewhere and so I think
7:06
that like this um this conflict between territory like on which territory we
7:11
should take over hasn't really risen up yet Yeah And I think ultimately it's more likely like Nathan said to rise
7:17
between Austria and Turkey because once you get to Moscow there's no more like
7:22
you get this one I get this one It's like okay who's taking Russia and who like is Turkey getting trapped or not
7:29
Versus with us in Austria or us in Turkey it's just like splitting the board So
7:34
okay So do you think that France and Russia
7:41
are still the most dominant powers on the board despite the fact that they are
7:46
being attacked on all sides I don't think well I think that they are
7:54
but also the fact that their territory has expanded so much that they're like
7:59
able to be attacked by so many countries while they do have a lot of resources and armies that like leaves them
8:06
particularly vulnerable So while they are now I don't think they will be soon
8:11
I hope they won't be soon I agree they are now just cuz like having so many
8:16
territories literally gives you so much more power But to Nathan's point once
8:21
every other team has four places and those two all of a sudden have six it feels very unfair which does give them a
8:29
disadvantage in terms of working with people And if you look at the map they they can be attacked by England Germany
8:35
Austria and Tur like Turkey That's like But still there's Yeah that's true
8:40
So they look like they can manipulate Do you think that there's any chance
8:46
they could successfully do that I think there's a chance Ove could successfully manipulate
8:51
Baya cuz it it looks like a fouronone or a four on three and it looks like oh
8:57
there's no way you can win but if you really look to the situation there's multiple ways you can win
9:04
I also think that there is a chance for I feel like the like the northern part of Europe is decently united as in like
9:12
Germany and England have some cooperation going on while IO is going on in the south But there is also a
9:19
possibility of Russia or Adve particularly pitting the northern part of Europe
9:25
against the southern part of Europe right Which puts us in the middle That would be interesting So you guys you
9:33
guys Basically you essentially predicted that France and Russia their place in the limelight is going to be over really
9:40
soon Who do you think will replace them as the dominant power with the most you
9:46
know power Well I think the optimal scenario for us
9:54
is probably everyone gaining in relatively equal amounts because it
10:00
can't be like it goes from us having four to us having seven because then we become the next target I think it should
10:07
be like oh we and Germany both gained a land this round Oh Germany you're so
10:14
much stronger than than England and equal to us let's divide up England or like same with Austria and Turkey
10:20
Although as long as we progress in the same level as one of them then I'm okay with it Yeah And I think like for us I
10:28
feel like our main strategy should be like gaining territories but not towards the center Like we're gaining if we were
10:34
to gain Spain and Portugal we're not like right in the middle where everybody can attack us Like if Germany for
10:40
example were to take a lot of territory they would be like the foremost power but they're also the most vulnerable to
10:46
being attacked by every single country essentially So
10:52
So there are outwardly threatening threats threatening powers threatening
10:58
countries but they're also more hidden threats The idea that someone could be
11:04
behind the scenes not being really noticed but also being very dangerous Who do you think right now is the most
11:11
underestimated Us Maybe I don't
11:17
know I maybe that's a little cocky of me to say but I
11:23
think that it's not it's not Russia and France
11:29
because they're overtly strong I don't have a lot I don't I don't know
11:35
if England is going to end up astonishing people I think like I
11:41
think they're great but I think that it's very easy to take them out if Germany decides to team with Russia or
11:48
US I think Austria might become strong but I don't know if I'd be shocked by that Mhm And I I don't know if Turkey I
11:55
don't know what's going to happen to Turkey but I think that generally people don't view us as very strong but I think
12:01
we have the potential to because the two territories we're after are side of the
12:07
board So it's not like people are going to be like you know conflicted with us over that It's just going to all of a
12:13
sudden be like oh shoot wait Italy has like six I didn't realize And they
12:18
either have to team or you know go against our ambitions have
12:23
like have not conflicted with anybody else's Yeah Thus far So maybe we're kind
12:29
of like less seen I also think it's interesting that it feels like we're facilitating most of these treaties or
12:38
like Yeah Yeah cooperation between the countries So I was thinking about that I
12:44
felt kind of bad cuz I I don't like it when America like meddles in other people's territories but we're acting
12:50
like "Oh Germany if you attack Borcha at this time the true proxy war." Yeah it's
12:55
kind of bad We're We have a lot of It feels like we have a lot of proxy wars Carrying on the true American tradition
13:02
Well that's interesting because that I up to this point I don't think that
13:08
Proxy Wars has been a major focus Why do you think that you should be engaging in
13:15
that proxy war behavior It you what benefits do you receive and which ones are you referring to exactly
13:25
Well we don't like France evidently I feel like that's obvious But
13:33
we cannot fight France from all sides Therefore if we want France to go by we
13:40
have to ensure that relations between England and Germany are at least successful enough to get rid of France
13:46
We don't like Russia We're not near Russia at all But also Audrey's is a slimy player
13:52
If if the someone teams with him and
13:57
gets suscept is susceptible to to Obbe's mischievous lies then I think that ultimately is
14:04
negative for us in the end if Odday becomes like the strongest other player Um and so that's why I am very
14:11
supportive of the affects you indirectly And so I think you have to like pay
14:16
attention otherwise randomly Turkey just convinced Austria to go against us and
14:22
you know what I mean you have to keep up your relations I think for like England and Germany initially we wanted them to
14:30
attack France because it would take away their support of Spain and Portugal and we could come in and take their like
14:36
resources On the other hand if you look to the east you see that Turkey and Austria are attacking Russia And by
14:43
having by allowing by facilitating that attack on Russia it takes away from the
14:48
vulnerabilities that we have in Venice and how easy it is to take like attack us from the Ionian Sea or Yeah through
14:55
Venice And so it takes away focus from us So I think that's ultimately
15:01
beneficial Would you consider yourselves the ones responsible for England and Germany attacking Russia
15:08
Russia or France Russia No We did know it was going to happen though We were aware of all plans Mhm
15:16
Ooh Are you okay Is do you have ever have that sinking feeling that really you aren't aware of all plans and that
15:23
you're just being tricked Well of course I think that everyone in this game might think like "Oh it's gonna work out but
15:29
it could just go to go to heck." But I think since the whole like um Germany
15:36
and Italy or Germany and England going against Russia like really I mean it doesn't really matter to us That one I
15:41
wasn't like "Oh no are they going to are they going to not?" Um I don't Yeah I had that sinking
15:51
feeling with Germany cuz we asked them to move into BUR Burgundy Wait that's
15:56
Burgundy Yeah Yeah But then they ended up giving us like a heads up like "Oh we're thinking of going to Warsaw
16:02
instead." And so I was like "Okay." It seems like generally the people around us that we trust um are willing to give
16:09
us like some sort of heads up And so the only thing that ever makes me nervous is France
16:15
because they'll be like "Oh we won't we don't will you please not do
16:20
this?" And we're like "Well we'll know." Yeah we're going to very many lies from every other
16:28
country about France So so what would need to happen in order
16:34
for you to stop your attack on France and instead become friends with them
16:42
I have my answer essentially nothing apart from being
16:47
attacked by Austria Yeah Is my answer I think that's fair Do
16:53
you not see this being a very likely scenario
16:58
I didn't until you said it like that What Okay No
17:04
I don't see it being likely Okay So but now you Okay No Okay I don't
17:13
think however our next
17:19
play Well actually we haven't talked about this but it is possible for us to do what we want without having to risk
17:26
our home base Yes Well what is it that say again Go ahead
17:32
Well what is it that you want without having to risk your home base We want the L Leo
17:42
Okay Well shifting to a different note
17:48
you have this alliance with Austria and Turkey When do you think you will need
17:54
when if ever do you think you will need to betray your allies for the upper hand
17:59
Do you think that's something that's going to happen soon or will that take a while
18:05
I'm not anticipating it immediately Yes But I think if that were to happen it
18:11
would have to be when Turkey I feel like Turkey is pitted against
18:16
Austria like just geographically And I think that like when that happens we
18:22
might capitalize on it But until that happens I don't really want to fight that war I think it's on Turkey Yeah I
18:31
think Turkeykey's best move in this game would be to take out Russia with Austria and then turn on them Would you support
18:39
Turkey in that war Depends on how strong Austria is
18:45
It all depends But if if if Turkey looks like it's going to win
18:51
maybe actually it also depends on how strong we are Yeah Like if we have if we
18:57
were in the same position as now I wouldn't risk it at all because we really need that border
19:02
security Um but if we end up getting Spain Portugal maybe Marseilles then I
19:09
wouldn't be like largely opposed Do you think there is a scenario where you stab
19:17
Turkey instead of Austria Yes probably Well that'd be kind of hard Mhm
19:29
Well theoretically we could by supporting Austria but I think Austria is able to
19:35
gain what are they called the command centers or what Yeah Yeah Like they're they're closer and they're able to take
19:42
it over faster and I don't think that we would get any of the spoils from that war So I think I think it'd be hard to
19:50
convince Austria to give us any Mhm because it'd be like "Oh we want smmy."
19:55
And it's so far removed from everything that it's so hard to strategically
20:00
defend I mean it would be kind of dumb of them to let us because if they were willing to split up
20:08
with us that would mean we're that this is Austria or and Italy just starts to
20:13
become a curve around them And I I don't think it's good for us to take it too because we're expending resources to try
20:19
to take something I don't think we can defend And it's easy to cut us off from that area too But if Austria ends up
20:25
being the one to take out Turkey then that's okay I just don't think there's a scenario where we
20:34
take part in Yeah Okay So you mentioned earlier that you wanted Marseilles you
20:41
wanted Spain and you wanted Portugal Once you get those three centers where are you going to get your next centers
20:49
Um it depends If Germany is stronger than and then than than Lond or England
20:56
then I think we take breast they Germany takes Paris We take LVP they take London
21:04
We just divide up England If England is the stronger one we go from Munich and start dividing up Germany and still
21:11
probably take Paris It seems like England has by taking over
21:16
England we would have more control over like the seas surrounding Europe So I
21:22
think maybe that is strategic to allow us to move around and provide support Do
21:28
you do you worry at all that moving your fleets all the way up to England will
21:33
put your fleets and your forces a little too far away from your homeland or is that not a concern I think it is It is
21:42
However the only case in which we would move all the way up to England is if we gained three centers which means we
21:49
would gain three new fleets or or armies And then it would be like next step take
21:55
breast next step take So then by the time we would actually be like extended
22:00
that far we would also have fourish three four more centers Mhm And I think
22:06
like the the two fleets that we have right now would probably be rotated right Yeah I think is the best play Yeah
22:14
And it would be because I mean once you once you take Portugal and Spain
22:22
there's no need to defend any like of the area back here So it starts to become a line just like closing in So
22:29
there's not as much to defend when it's just us in that area
22:34
So aside from taking out France right now what do you think is the most important thing for you guys to do
22:40
moving forward Have good relations with Germany and
22:46
Austria Yeah Would you achieve that by talking
22:53
nice or offering up any substantive ground
22:59
I think Oh go ahead I don't think we have anything to offer them apart from Venice but that is nothing I don't think
23:07
that is we have yeah we have no currently we have nothing to offer except for like land
23:14
security because Venice is so close to Triest and Munich which are both key
23:19
centers for the other two that the best we can offer and this is pretty good actually the best we can offer is not
23:25
attacking them but you you kind of So not or with good say that again Oh
23:34
sorry Say again Or good game strategies Okay So you raise at least kind of an
23:41
interesting concept The idea of not attacking being in of itself the reward
23:46
all along But how would you make it so that Germany and Austria would feel the
23:52
same way How would you make it so that they don't feel compelled to attack you
23:58
I think there's no way to make someone feel that way outside of convincing them
24:03
Um so we have to convince them that other routes are more lucrative for them
24:11
which I'm not I'm not like making it up when I say it I genu I do really believe
24:16
that Germany's Germany is going to get more out of going after upper France and
24:22
and England than going for Italy And I think that
24:28
Austria would probably actually take us out really fast But I think that because
24:34
Russia is currently being played by Ove who is like not the most honest and
24:40
trustworthy of players that it is beneficial for them And you know they also divided it was their idea to divide
24:47
up the Balkans I wasn't we weren't a part of that you know like they were like they were very uh they took
24:52
initiative and they were like how do we get these centers How do we divide these up peacefully So Austria is already playing very peaceful and so I'm we're
24:59
more than happy to just be like yeah I think they also seek that security and peace So at least right now All right I
25:07
think this might be one of the last questions but when it comes to Italy do
25:14
you think that fleets are more important or that armies are more important What's the correct ratio between the two
25:23
Um for our current game strategy fleets are a little more important Uh eventually armies will be more
25:30
important I think maybe we're currently we're currently
25:35
50/50 Mhm I think that towards the east like if we were to move things into the
25:41
Ionian Sea or ADR I don't know what that's called Adriatic Oh okay But I
25:47
think that they're so vulnerable to like multiple attacks but also like it's good to have armies there to support So I
25:55
think like in terms of offense towards the west I think it's definitely fleets but to defense I think both are equally
26:03
important I think overall probably 60/40 fleets 60 cuz it's offensive and army's
26:10
40 cuz it's defensive and we're tiny And I think yeah like our way of expansion is hindered by three countries So I
26:18
think it's better if we invest in fleets
26:24
All right Well I'm all out of questions unless Ernest would like to ask some of his own
26:30
Well it's more on how do you go about negotiating And it's I asked this in not
26:37
like a um who do you choose or what you use but how in what manner do you guys
26:44
say stuff Uh well I I do a lot of talking Yeah cuz
26:51
I just I don't know Why do I talk more than you I don't know I think I'm not as
26:59
good at like keeping a straight face or like lying my way through it Yeah Better liar huh But I als I think our main way
27:06
is incentivizing or giving bigger like bigger and better things to accomplish
27:12
rather than attacking us Yeah I think that we're not I actually don't like lying in this game unless they have to I
27:20
think our strategy so far has been like kind of honestly
27:26
laying it out how it is The way we lay it out is that it benefits us but it's it's not like oh you'll never you know
27:33
like you need us I've never we've never said like you need Italy to survive No one's noticed that Nobody needs Italy to
27:40
survive But we've phrased as like hey we want peace on this border or like we've
27:46
been very honest that we don't like France So you know like I think that that gains us a certain amount of like
27:52
reliability and trust in the game And so you know we were a part of Operation
27:59
Popcorn It's true What is Operation Popcorn
28:04
Oh that's what we called the That's what Well that's what Russia called the scheme where Russia
28:11
and um what's it called Turkey were gonna team up on Austria They called Operation
28:19
Popcorn because they liked popcorn chicken and then changed it to popcorn because Baguio was vegetarian but I
28:26
called it Operation Popcorn because that's what you say when you lie in um ES
28:32
and we duped Russia out So it was like we said we all thought this we all said this was going to happen and then we did
28:37
a different thing So that's the only time we like overtly lied Like we told France they were like "Will you please not going to West Will you please?" So
28:43
we were like "Yeah we'll think about it."
28:49
Hi Who is that It's Hyen Okay Sorry I don't know Um so I think our strategy has been
28:57
like insight and wisdom in a way that reflects what we
29:03
want Do you think that is a successful model
29:12
I think it's successful until the end of the game which I've never reached It's been like one time I played
29:19
a game where actually it worked the whole time in that game I ended up taking nine centers and eventually I did
29:26
have to turn on my ally which was the English and she was like will you please
29:32
do this Will you please not do this And I was like I felt really bad and so I honestly just told her I was like I'm sorry I can't te with you anymore You're
29:38
too weak and she was like "I understand." And so it was it like actually did work in that scenario Like
29:44
she knew I was going to turn on her Um and I think it will work in this game until we're down to like three stronger
29:51
players and then at some point it's going to have but that's when it that's
29:57
when it wins you is when it's it like if you build the trust all the way until the absolute makeorb breakak situation
30:04
then you have the choice to either snap it in half or like keep it And if you ultimately have to
30:09
like be like "I won't attack any of my ships on you even though we have five surrounding you I swear on God and then
30:17
you all of a sudden just like sorry sorry dog I had to do it." Then like that's a beneficial way to win the game

A has gained a lot of distrust by saying to everyone "The other team's teaming against you You think that Austria is
30:30
going to do this but really they're not It's Turkey." And like he's which is not
30:35
going to play Everyone's like "Hey did did he say this to you?" And we're like "Yep." But I think by if we're going for
30:42
a fleet heavy strategy we're going to like expand our territory like pretty quickly But I it also leaves us
30:47
undefended Yeah And so I think while we can expand we really have to focus on
30:53
our home country and we need to ensure that while we're putting like goals or like territories to offer from other
31:00
countries and like forming plans on how on in which ways other countries can like achieve these territories we still
31:06
need to ensure that us ourselves do not outweigh right the benefits that we are giving up We
31:14
always have to frame it as like an even deal Like we're both getting something
31:19
Yeah Cuz otherwise why would you take the deal I don't know why just gave France
31:25
Belgium That was very France Like you know what I mean
