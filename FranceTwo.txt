0:03
hello hey guys hey can you hear me yeah we can it's just It is a little bit
0:09
shaky but it'll be fine for now okay so the way we're doing this is going to be a little bit different than last time
0:16
we're going to go phase by phase to like kind of probe where your heads were at
0:22
like as the game was going on and I guess we could start right now if
0:28
it's not a problem for you Elena oh yeah no worries okay yeah sorry you didn't have like the time it's fine it's
0:35
fine so here it's like so here this is coming off of a year where everybody
0:42
seemed to be turning against you yet uh do you think that you handled this year
0:47
well was there anything you could have done better or uh like can you walk me through your thought process of why you
0:53
did what you did
1:03
here oh I remember this year we allied with the English finally to
1:09
help them into Belgium uh on the condition that we would get
1:15
Belgium later it was kind of a risk that we had to take because we couldn't fight like a three-sided war but like getting
1:23
the English on our side like eventually turned like fruitful okay that's So this is a crucial year
1:30
for you you managed to ward off the English attack um so what do you So was it that uh that
1:39
proposal or was it something else that made you do you think that made England uh decide to join up with you
1:48
yeah I think it was like we kind of used Sean's I like what we were talking about
1:55
last call of you said something about like giving the other side something that they would want and
2:03
like really pushing for that and like even conceding in order for that to happen so that you can kind of build
2:09
trust build trust and I think that's what we did and I think that it really was helpful for them and like allowed us
2:17
repair that relationship and I think that was a crucial thing that we did because like Sean was saying like we
2:23
really could not fight that war on all three sides but yeah
2:29
so would you describe your relationship with the English which was I assume created on this phase to be like a
2:37
longlasting thing or is it conditional
2:43
I won't say it seems longlasting I would yeah I would hope so like we
2:50
know that they're allies in Austria like long term but we're hoping
2:55
that because of this situation we helps them like break into uh central Europe
3:02
like into the mainland so like if we can like I don't know like keep reminding of them keep reminding them of how like we
3:09
were useful and getting them into the mainland to start with because they had like their army was still stuck in Wales
3:16
and they like they couldn't just use fleets the entire time so we're hoping that we could remind them of how we like
3:22
started this i see so how do you know that Austria and
3:28
England are allied together at this point uh through the grape i think at one
3:34
point they told I told
3:48
Sorry what' you say i didn't say Elena did you cut out there
3:54
for a second oh sorry um I think I said uh that I
4:02
think that they told us like I think I was having a conversation with Jessica and I was like "Oh like do like X." And
4:10
I think she was like "Oh well like Austria blah blah blah." But I could be Mr colin
4:17
i heard it from like third parties i think probably Russia and then I like I like
4:25
told I like mentioned it and passed it to Amber and she's like "Oh how'd you know?" I was like "Okay great." Like
4:32
kind of obvious i see so the other the other thing that's happening here is
4:38
Russia is successfully getting into Keel and you and you and England working together against Germany here also seems
4:46
like a pretty good indicator of oh Germany's kind of on the on the ropes now they're falling what are your
4:52
thoughts on that oh yeah like we had to mediate between Russia and England to actually get them
4:59
to work together so I think that's like like pretty good negotiating on our part
5:06
to like have three countries working down working together to take down the only problem is like Russia
5:13
still kind of held up its deal but that it move into Norway and from the Balkans
5:19
into Keel was unexpected like I think England was kind of pissed
5:26
after that but after uh Russia explained it to them because we had to we had to mediate again to like have them not
5:33
fight for now so we could take down the rest of Germany so like I think we still played a pretty important role in that
5:40
why is it why is it important to take out Germany at at this stage of the game
5:47
why was it important i mean I think earlier like Germany and
5:52
England were working together I think to get us out if I remember correctly so I
5:58
think that we were just kind of trying to focus or like targeting on like one
6:05
of the three and like England we needed to kind of ally with and Italy was just like it was not the right spot so I
6:14
think Germany was kind of like the one yeah I think for me it was like it was
6:19
impossible to like at least for us it was like hard to talk to Italy to get
6:25
them to back off and then Germany can't really hurt England because they have
6:32
like one fleet uh yeah they had one fleet and it was like super hard for
6:40
them to like get into England especially with the the North Sea there and just England has so much like fleet power
6:46
that like Germany can't really hurt England so and it was like a natural target for both England and Russia so
6:54
convincing them was like convincing them to attack Germany was like
7:00
is it is it more it so the effort to take out Germany was more an effort to
7:06
keep your enemies busy while you could focus on Italy is that correct
7:13
yeah it was like to keep them busy like attacking each other with our support but I think we didn't realize the threat
7:20
in Italy soon enough all right let's move on to the next
7:27
phase uh you decide to destroy the army in Picard um do you think that like uh
7:35
had any significant weight in your game
7:42
i would say not really there was not much use for picky because it couldn't
7:48
help the English attack um into Germany and we kind of needed
7:54
everything down there and gasket or say to hold on yeah I feel like we need to
8:00
focus on the south so I don't think that like ticker or that tickery like
8:08
for us by taking it out all right okay let's move on to the next movement phase
8:16
where unfortunately Italy Italy pulls off this move what were your feelings or
8:21
your thoughts on this whole ordeal i was like so surprised like I did not
8:28
see that convoy order coming like I thought we accounted for everything
8:34
like but like that's like the one that surprised us that they would use everything to take him to like Spain
8:44
yeah it was like that like oh crap feeling like oh we we kind of missed that
8:50
so there are a couple of other interesting things happening here like this bounce in Venice between Italy and
8:58
Austria uh what do you think happened there um so we kind of like made uh made
9:07
contact with Austria in the last phase or the phase before that like starting
9:12
to work on them like hopefully turning against Italy but then we realized that like Austria
9:19
could get like really strong and then so we kind of gave like Italy a heads up because we didn't want
9:26
them to take Munich and Venice because then we would just be replacing like one
9:31
enemy with like an even greater enemy but in like retrospect I think that
9:37
might have been a bad idea because now Italy is like all the
9:43
way on our now right you regret that decision you wish that
9:48
Italy was weaker instead yeah i just wish the Austrians just took out Venice and we didn't warn Italy
9:55
about uh What were your negotiations like with the English at this point in the game
10:07
at this point we're kind of in like somewhat constant communication
10:14
um they're like pretty honest or like I feel like I can trust them when they say
10:20
like they are open about like oh yeah like we're not going to do that or like we are going to do this like if we
10:25
suggest something they won't just like say oh yeah we're going to do it they'll
10:30
they'll say they're they'll say if they don't so I feel like it's like a pretty
10:37
stable relationship right now like there wasn't much we could do but
10:43
we But like we tried to offer like Burgundy attacking Roar just in case it
10:48
like tries to support hold Poland or something so like we still tried to
10:54
offer what we could contribute to like so that we're we still stay all of
10:59
course we still had to I think we were still talking to Russia at this phase on
11:05
how to split up Germany along with England there they still had troubles
11:11
over in like Scandinavia on how to split that up so we like tried to like talk as
11:17
best as we could about who gets what and hopefully to also keep the English and
11:23
Russia busy with each other as well all right I heard a noise from Elena's side
11:31
but that's fine we're going to move on to the next phase where you move into
11:37
Belgium and you do not take Spain back
11:42
there are a couple of interesting things to talk about this turn i want to talk first about this move into Belgium was
11:48
this arranged or was this a stab that was arranged like they were willing
11:55
to give Belgium back like that was what we agreed to like we would support them
12:00
into Belgium on the condition that once they get Holland that we would get Belgium back like it was kind of a I
12:07
guess a risk that we had to take like trusting to uh stay on their word but
12:13
I'm glad that like it worked out the other interesting thing here was Austria
12:18
holding all units when they could have like uh done something really useful
12:24
with them what are your thoughts on that
12:29
oh yeah we tried really hard to have to convince them to uh move either Tyia or
12:36
Trias to move Trius into us with Tyia support but they just really wouldn't go
12:42
for it because they really wanted us to support them into Munich but we needed to take Belgium back on this turn so
12:48
that we could uh so that we could keep the same uh army silence so that we
12:54
wouldn't have to disband another unit but like and like Gabe and Seline I guess they're very transactional in
13:01
their dealing so they were like "Well if you don't help us now then we're not going to help attack Italy." Because
13:07
they also don't want to start another war which I guess is fair but like kind of
13:16
sad but okay that's that's an interesting take um let's see what else
13:24
happened here um I think we're ready to move on to the
13:31
next phase that was the those are the most important bits the the other thing is actually you helped so much in like
13:38
taking down Germany right but you're not getting any of the German centers you're
13:43
only going to be getting Belgium out of this conflict how do you feel about that
13:50
i think we have like I guess enough to worry about i guess that we do kind of
13:56
deserve something else but it's kind of hard to make I don't know i don't know
14:02
how to like try to convince them to give us another center yeah i don't know because then
14:10
Austria Well in the next uh days they also advanced to Munich so like even though they weren't part of the
14:16
conversations they just kind of like sneaked in there yeah yeah like we
14:24
probably should have tried to get like another center but I think that in the end it was so worth it to target Germany
14:32
and like I don't regret that we did that just because it didn't like turn out
14:38
that way what do you think was the main cause behind the fall of
14:44
Germany
14:52
i don't know if there was like any particular action on their part i think it was just the fact that like all three
14:58
of us were like targeting it and I think in that scenario it's like a little bit inevitable
15:07
yeah like I don't know they like um they
15:13
overextended like into uh into Praida and Sencia and then they kind of left
15:21
like some like holes in their centers um which is like kind of like
15:28
the opportunity that we used to convince England that they're like they're pretty weak right now that they left like a lot
15:35
of centers open and that they could like take them right now with our help and also like convince Russia to take a
15:41
share all right would you So and you I I'm
15:48
pretty sure I already know the answer to this one but you would call that a diplomatic success correct
15:55
yeah pretty much it's all your fault right you did this
16:05
okay I'm going to move on to the next phase which is a build phase how do you
16:10
feel about going net zero here no builds no destroys
16:18
pretty pissed because like Stain is gone now we couldn't get another bill and now
16:24
like we're completely surrounded in the south it was like we should have six
16:30
armies right now not five
16:35
what are your thoughts on Italy building an army with your stolen center
16:48
i don't know because I was going to say I don't know because
16:54
like if they built a fleet in Naples or
17:00
Yeah then it would have been like seen as a threat to Austria and they obviously don't want to attack Austria
17:06
right now so I guess that like that kind of makes sense like the army in Venice could also be used for another convoy
17:13
order potentially but I don't know when the Italians are trying to take
17:19
someone out do you think a fleet would have been more effective against you that an army
17:24
would
17:31
have i don't really know because the only way a fleet would be helpful is if
17:37
it got into like North Africa or if like the west fleet also
17:43
moved out into the mid-Atlantic if they moved into the mid-Atlantic that would be like that would be kind of bad
17:49
because they could target like they could target three
17:55
centers so I don't know okay we're going to move on to the next
18:00
phase wait the Oh the here's the other thing I wanted to ask what are your thoughts on Russia right now being the
18:08
board leader with eight supply centers
18:16
i think even though they have a lot of centers and like they have like eight armies I don't think that
18:23
like necessarily shows them in the lead because a lot of their centers are kind
18:29
of in like precarious situations like Norway
18:34
Romania and surrounded and then yeah and they barely got a foothold
18:41
in Berlin which I think in the current day like it could go out in a
18:48
year so I think even though they have eight armies it doesn't necessarily show them as like the strongest
18:58
what are your thoughts Alena yeah I agree i think
19:04
that they're a bit like vulnerable in certain spots but I do think they'll
19:09
definitely be in this game for like a long time i'm not surprised by the fact that they are like so far in the lead
19:17
but I wouldn't I think that like Austria in comparison definitely
19:24
has like a lot less like armies and like but I feel like I have a little bit more
19:31
like if I had to bet on this game I feel like I would bet more towards them even
19:36
though they're not like in the league all right moving on to this phase where you successfully
19:45
defend your centers down here in this very confusing move order honestly I
19:52
don't think anything really special here happened but do you think that do you
19:58
think that you'll be able to capture Spain anytime soon
20:07
i think so it'll okay i think it's like kind of a
20:13
gamble because if we have all four surrounding armies going to
20:19
Spain then Marseilles could be lost if they try to take it uh with Leon and
20:28
Piedmont on the other hand if we like predict that and only use three armies
20:34
to attack Spain we could move the Mid-Atlantic to North Africa and Portugal goes into Spain so
20:42
that we can like dislodge the fleet in West or into Asia i don't know i feel like there are too many variables here
20:49
like we would have to like think it over yeah I think it could go like either way
20:55
if we like play our card so the other thing that has happened here Germany has been officially wiped
21:03
off the board with their two disbands do you think that there was any
21:10
way you could have used Germany in the future or was this an inevitability their
21:16
death oh yeah I I texted Harini and Toni to like move one of their dislodged
21:23
units into Rur because then that could be used along with uh the Russian army
21:31
in Cissia and our army in Burgundy to dislodge Munich but I guess they just
21:37
like they gave up and it's like hard to take back Munich now especially because
21:43
the English put a fleet in Keel instead of an army so like I guess Munich is
21:48
pretty much in Austria's hands for at least now that's like kind of like trouble because also if there's because
21:56
of the Italian Austrian alliance it could potentially hurt us if like we're
22:02
trying to cut off support or anything do you think that Austria is likely to
22:07
attack Italy sometime in the future
22:12
i really hope so i hate the Italians yeah I suck at that
22:19
but right now I don't think so because
22:25
um because it's they they uh they moved out of
22:30
Tyia which means that there's like no possible way that they could take on uh
22:35
Italy right now or like break into Venice
22:41
okay well do you think that negotiations
22:48
between England and Russia are going to break down soon especially concerning
22:54
Scandinavia yeah I think that it will i think that
23:00
even in like the short amount of time that we've been negotiating with the two of them it has like gotten slightly less
23:07
rocky at times and at least like in like conversations with Justin and Amber like
23:13
I know that they've like consistently disrupted like Russ Russia
23:20
and like specifically so yeah I think that it's like going to break down and
23:26
so I think that like this kind of like trio alliance that we've kind of had now
23:34
that like Germany is kind of like officially off the board i or like almost off the board I think that like
23:40
it's kind of done although I'm still going to try to help
23:47
like the Russians keep up a battle up in the northern area because it would also
23:53
keep the English detention away from us hopefully they can keep like battling
23:58
that out while we finish our uh Mediterranean campaign yeah so yeah it's
24:05
funny you mentioned that cuz you have moved out of breast and you moved out of Belgium here leaving yourself open to a
24:11
possible English stab how do you think that you are going to prevent this scenario from happening do you think
24:17
it's likely to happen yeah that was kind of like the scary part of moving everything out but we
24:24
kind of did everything to like attack Italy and I guess we'll have to like try
24:32
to talk to the penguin tomorrow again to like make sure that I guess that they won't attack us
24:39
but it's just kind of like it's all based on like hope right now and that
24:45
Italy or Austria hasn't convinced England to us because like we said we we
24:51
told the English before that if we did like die we would give them our territories to them as opposed to the
24:59
Italians like hopefully that's like incentive for them to like help
25:04
supporting us welcome Ernest uh we I I'm sorry i
25:10
looked like we were going to start at 9:30 we started at 9 anyway but Okay Kenan so basically I missed only Okay i
25:17
tried saying I tried messaging you on Instagram it didn't i I looked at 9:30 and uh That's my bad that's our bad
25:25
sorry uh so you said that what are what
25:30
are you going to say to England specifically in order to make sure that
25:36
they do not move into Breast and that they do not move into Belgium
25:45
i think that like reminds them of like what we've done to them in the past and kind of how like we have sacrificed to
25:52
them in the past and we are like worth more to them if we stay in the game
25:58
longer than if they help take us out
26:04
can you talk to them during uh second period yeah yeah I can talk to Jessica during
26:11
second period and like hopefully Amber during class period if I see her yeah I
26:17
can also talk to Amber and Jessica during lunch if need be okay sounds good
26:23
well it seems like that's a plan um we haven't really talked about Turkey all
26:29
that much although it makes sense they don't have much of an effect on your
26:34
whole position do you have any uh significant thoughts on their downfall
26:40
and how it might change Russia and Austrian actions
26:46
i really hoped that they would help Russia instead of Austria but I have no
26:52
idea what's going on down there and in the last turn Turkey used Galia to like
26:59
help take down Romania i don't know i just wish they would use their dying moves to help
27:05
Russia instead of Austria but guess there's not much that we could do about it
27:12
all right let's move on to the present where we are right now and what you'll
27:18
have to do the orders you'll have to execute later so moving on what do you think is
27:24
the most important thing for you guys to do in order to further your goals and
27:30
maybe win this game
27:35
we would have to either convince the Italians to move back or like figure out some strategy to
27:44
make them disband their unit in Spain or convince Austria to attack
27:50
them and England to not attack us i guess kind of like resting on a lot of
27:57
things like it's like we're not in a good position right now but if we can just like take down the Italians that
28:05
would be great yeah exactly
28:11
who do you think has the best prospects of winning this game right now
28:21
i think Austria especially since they've taken down Munich and they're they've taken
28:29
back Romania like it's like I think England and Austria are strongest right now but I
28:35
think that England hasn't broken into like the mainland Europe now which is
28:42
like where a lot of centers are so I think that Austria will reach Italy
28:48
Turkey Russia uh f and Germany faster than the English
28:53
can yeah and like even aside from like where
29:00
where they are like presently on the board I think that like Austria has
29:06
proven that they are like really good at negotiating even when it like seems like
29:13
the other countries should make a different move so like I don't know what they're doing or how they're convincing people but it's worked so I think that
29:22
it'll continue to work and that will really like play their advantage
29:27
so uh Russia when we talked last seemed to be on the back foot yet they have
29:34
persisted what would you attribute that like that status too why do you think
29:40
they survived when it seemed like all signs were pointing to their defeat
29:51
honestly I don't know yeah I don't really know either kind of
29:56
surprised me like talks to everyone so he knows a little bit about what everyone is doing
30:04
like even even though his guesses aren't always correct at least he like like
30:10
he's trying to talk to everyone so I guess that helps
30:16
who do you think besides obviously Germany and Turkey will be the next big loser
30:26
you raised your hand do does that mean you think it's you i think
30:32
maybe I think
30:37
it's I think either US or Italy i don't know actually
30:43
yeah it's like exactly what I was thinking too which I'm obviously hoping
30:49
Italy because I hate Italy and also I don't want to but yeah I feel like those
30:54
are kind of like as of right now obviously you guys perceive yourself to
31:00
be in a disadvantaged position so what is motivating you to continue fighting
31:07
when things seem sort of bleak that the Italians don't win that's it
31:18
everything to make sure that they were like we don't want Italy to win
31:23
is there any chance that you might be able to maybe turn this around into a place
31:32
where you could be in a winning in a winner scenario
31:38
i thought about that a little bit but it's like the only way that would happen is if we
31:44
can take down Italy with Austria's help just a little bit like just a little bit so they don't take all of it but then we
31:52
would need to stab England through the Mid-Atlantic and breast like I think
31:58
that would be like the only way because I think if England keeps leaving its
32:05
home centers as open as it could we could move a fleet into the North Atlantic Ocean and then take Liverpool
32:12
on the next turn which if that we can just like convince them to keep expanding and then like just enough time
32:20
for us to take down Italy then I think that would be our next target and we could have a pretty good chance but
32:26
that's like far off in the future
32:33
ernest I'm sorry that we started this without you do you have any questions um
32:39
well I would ask the entire interview again but I assume you have all the answers
32:45
um is mostly on how are you going to defend against Italy and Russia at the
32:50
same time what's Austria what do you think Austria is doing in Munich and
32:55
what do you think uh England's going to do in Holland that that was it
33:05
uh for the first part of the question I think we still have to like
33:11
figure that out like to either have like all four armies attack Spain and
33:17
potentially give up more or like
33:25
I don't know like take a gamble and that they're not going to uh
33:31
like support hold Spain as hard as possible if they're not going to do that
33:36
and we could sneak them in Atlantic into North Africa and hopefully get Portugal to
33:42
Spain but I don't know i think we'll still have to talk
33:50
okay and act your other questions oh um
33:55
what is Holland doing and what is Mutton doing
34:02
munich i don't think Munich can do really anything at the moment hopefully
34:08
because it would have to be support held by Bohemia just in case we try to rush
34:18
and for Holland I hope they
34:26
don't all right do you guys have any questions for us
34:34
um wait i did
34:44
oh is there like a Oh sorry do you have something
34:52
oh no i didn't uh how do you usually tell Do you know Do you have like a clear answer on who
34:58
do you think the winner will be um no I do not i I I'm glad I can be
35:06
honest about that because if I did I would say like that I that I can't tell
35:11
you the the thing is about diplomacy as soon as somebody seems to be getting the
35:16
lead like everybody else is going to notice it if they're good players and
35:21
they're going to try their best to like kind of fight back against it if they if
35:26
they're good players yeah no no no yeah because
35:33
Well okay the I'm joking
35:39
if Yeah but um so in that way like the
35:45
game itself balances who's going to win and stuff like that because the people
35:50
that are more likely to win have a harder road in front of them while the people who don't look like they're going
35:56
to win potentially have an easier road in front of them if you get what I'm saying
36:02
do you have any more how long does it say how long does it usually take for the game to end like by what year
36:09
it's a good question you see sometimes these games can last quite a while i've
36:15
I've played one that had lasted all the way to 1916 and there have
36:21
been very very long games the longest game happened over the course of three
36:28
real world years like it took him three actual
36:33
years to play it and the game ended in 2005 like game years
36:39
so um that was played over the course of several days like we're doing right now
36:44
but typically if in a beginner
36:49
game I would say it lasts around till 1908 to
36:58
1910 but it could be dragged out for much longer
37:03
so prepare yourself we might not get a conclusion to this conflict
37:11
i in during the summer do you have any more questions
37:16
for us
37:22
