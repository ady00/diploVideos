0:00
how many have you gone through uh you're going to be our third we have two more after you and once we're done with all
0:06
of them I'll give you the raw footage while Ernest works on a compilation video
0:12
i see
0:20
[Music]
0:31
oh yeah how come you start your your school year in January Kenan oh it's
0:36
it's some I got into this liberal studies core program
0:42
and for some reason at NYU they have it so that you could either start after
0:50
summer break or you could start in January that's called the spring start like amount of people and other people
0:57
it's not just me a whole group of people are doing the spring start although I'm
1:02
not sure if I like that idea so I just applied today to see if I can ch be changed to the fall start the one that
1:09
starts like earlier and I kind of what I do kind of hinges on that because if I
1:15
don't get into the fall start I'm going to go to Laspacitus College and if I do I'm just going to go straight to NYU and
1:22
I need to figure out my craps quick if I that happens because I'm a little behind on housing on roommates and all that
1:29
stuff so you might do like a lost bow and then
1:34
transfer to Would you still go out of state uh yeah because I it'll just I'll just
1:43
be getting credits at Laspo and then So he doesn't so he just doesn't miss a semester of college yes
1:52
so you mentioned you were unemployed sean are you looking to go into some job uh what is what's
2:00
interested you so far i I I experienced it firsthand today like I was at the Oh
2:07
hi hey go on Sean i'm interested i was uh I was
2:13
with Ernest and Herini earlier and then we went to like um this boba place near
2:18
Harini's house and I was just I just asked them if they were hiring so I'm just like going around asking oh that's
2:24
cool all right so one question that I quickly
2:33
want to get out the way because I've I've been especially interested is now that this game is over
2:41
like what do you what is your main takeaway right was it was it fun was it
2:47
good bad what's up um it was like a roller coaster of
2:53
emotions it took up like a lot of time it was like it was pretty fun
3:00
overall yeah I would agree with that it was a lot more like time consuming than I was
3:06
expecting but I ended up also being more invested than I thought I would be so like overall I think it was like fun and
3:12
like I would do it again great that's what I love i never sent so many messages
3:22
so sorry about that because I I'm going to go straight from that general question into a very specific oriented
3:29
question here is where we left off if you could see my screen um now a couple
3:35
things are happening here first off you are no longer attacking Italy which you had been doing up until this point and
3:44
England is moving into the Mid-Atlantic Ocean seemingly without your permission
3:50
so first let's touch up on the Italy thing what encouraged you to kind of
3:55
stop attacking each other
4:01
[Music] i lowkey forgot but I think we realized
4:07
that it was hard for us to invade their homeland because we had three fleets and
4:14
they had three fleets and an army against us so I think maybe that's why if I remember correctly yeah I think
4:21
you're right Sean i think that's what happened and then we just like talked to them about like demilitarizing that
4:27
whole entire area because we were like this isn't going to work out for like either of us
4:34
well if I were to get even more specific um was the hold in Pedmont and
4:44
planned oh sorry yeah the Pima and West was that planned
4:51
oh oh I was gone that day I think oh I think I remember this yeah I think this
4:57
was when Wait I think this was when they said that we don't trust you yet so like
5:03
you do it first and we'll do it next round right yeah I think
5:08
so yeah so them holding was planned but like it was also planned that eventually
5:14
they would they would move out how about onto the English side of
5:20
things um clearly they moved into Mid-Atlantic Ocean how do you feel about
5:25
that was that un that was not planned I'm guessing yeah that was like a what the [ __ ] just
5:33
happened yeah after that kind of stopped talking I think or maybe we talked for
5:39
like one more round and it was like over yeah I think I remember when it happened we like texted them and then I don't
5:46
remember what their excuse was but it was like somewhat believable it was I
5:52
think it was about like Italy or something they said that they were going to like help us and we were like can you get out there that's not
5:58
happening so So you're saying it was this moment
6:05
where you basically went radio silent with England do you think that was a
6:11
good decision or should you have maybe communicated more
6:17
i think we did try talking to them they just kept lying I think yeah cuz I think
6:24
Jessica was gone that day yeah Jessica was gone that day so it was just us trying to talk to Amber but uh low key I
6:32
think Jessica was the brains behind this move so yeah let's see what makes you
6:39
think is the brains let's see how Amber feels about that when she
6:47
I apologize in advance Amber our our interview with England was just for reference it was like right before grad
6:55
so things got a little bit I I missed the first portion so I have to watch it but yeah
7:01
all right so moving on to the next season over here
7:09
unfortunately England takes breast and
7:15
also Okay so nothing too especially interesting I believe is happening here
7:21
like but you did mention last turn that Italy was going to move out and they
7:26
failed to do that here was that part of the plan i think I think it was like once we move
7:33
out then they move out it's not like a like we tried and then they'll try to
7:38
move out but yeah I think that's what happened is we were like "Well we can't
7:44
move out anymore." So our like deal with them just kind of like fizzled out
7:50
hold on a second what's up
7:57
i was going to ask a question but he seems busy i'll wait
8:09
sorry about that um you're good so uh where was I oh yeah so yeah that
8:18
it's very clearly how that works out there is a couple of things happening
8:24
here at least when it comes to the front with Russia right here you moved
8:29
Burgundy into Munich what was the goal of that oh we had a miscommunication we were
8:36
going to have um Burgundy move into Munich with Roar
8:43
supporting but then like we miscommunicated or something and that didn't end up
8:50
happening because you can see the Belgium tried to support whole roar which we thought because we thought it
8:56
was going to support move us so we should have taken Munich that
9:01
turn but yeah I see so that that I think this raises a very interesting point
9:09
like you seem I mean like it doesn't even seem to be like a very conscious
9:14
decision that you're making but just like a no-brainer of oh you got to work with the Russians right but
9:23
um do you think there's any consequence behind doing that because like at this point they're the strongest player and
9:30
helping out the strongest player or receiving help from the strongest player dealing with the strongest player might
9:36
all might not always be the best idea was that something you were thinking of when you were dealing with Russia
9:46
i think low key I didn't really care i was just like I was just like "Oh I want someone
9:52
to win this game but I don't want us to be like losing the game
9:58
yeah I think at this point in the game I mean if I remember correctly England was like the second most powerful and we
10:05
were just trying to like defend ourselves against them and so to us it
10:10
didn't really seem like we were helping Russia win but more so that we were just like defending ourselves and preventing
10:18
England from becoming more powerful okay um moving on i'm moving
10:27
you decided Oh this is just I feel like this is just a brutal turn for you guys more
10:33
armies on the English homeland and you have to destroy like a unit of yours
10:39
what encouraged you to destroy Portugal in specific if you remember at all
10:48
i think it was because we lowkey didn't really need it i I think Gaskanany could
10:56
be set up to attack Breast burgundy could be used either to support
11:03
Belgium or take in take Munich and then Marseilles has to stay and then the
11:09
south coast of Spain yeah the south coast of Spain yeah i I guess it just
11:15
has to be there to pro protect against Italy I guess but I think we moved out anyways so it didn't really matter
11:24
let me know what's going in your head right now about like um your army in
11:31
Belgium and to a lesser extent Burgundy um what is your land army
11:38
strategy from here on out
11:44
i think I think we knew that Belgium would be lost either way because there's the English Channel Holland and North
11:51
Sea bordering it and I don't think we could have relied on Russia too much to help us because they have enough
11:58
worrying about so I think it was the main focus was trying to take back breast
12:08
let's see how you guys decided to go about that um it looks like you communicated
12:13
correctly with Russia this time but aside from that nothing too
12:18
remarkable at least here what are your thoughts on Italy holding all units here
12:27
wait Elena was that the day like they didn't they forget
12:33
if I think they forgot to turn in orders and that's why they held right yeah I
12:38
think so something about Mac and her dog oh yeah
12:44
because I think that Italy was supposed to help us with something i think they I think Weso was supposed to support us
12:51
into Mal yeah yeah yeah so wait you confronted
12:58
her about it and she said there's something with her dog i don't think she texted us yeah she
13:04
texted us first and she was like like our bad guys but like it worked out for you guys anyways and it didn't it was
13:10
fine so it didn't really screw us over in the end so
13:17
yeah um Ernest do you have anything to ask here oh yeah like in terms of communication at this stage in the game
13:24
how much are you communicating with each country h
13:31
I think we were communicating most with like Russia and Italy i think this was
13:37
like the first time when we were kind of like on good terms with Italy
13:42
specifically yeah and I don't think we were on speaking terms after we with Austria
13:47
after we took Munich i think I think after that this like after this turn or
13:53
the next we were trying to convince them to go after Italy again but that didn't work out the old the tried and
13:59
true trying to convince Austria to attack Italy it's something that's been happening the entire game so you me so
14:07
you would classify your relationship with Italy here as much better as it had
14:12
historically been do you find pride in that achievement
14:20
i mean not really i mean I don't think that was we had like a better relationship because of
14:27
like negotiations or anything on our part i think that Italy was just aware
14:32
of the fact that if we fell to England they would be next and so they were kind of like forced to stop
14:40
being like very rivaly towards us so you would say that Sean had something
14:47
to say sean Sean say no i'm letting him say it you know
14:52
oh and I think Italy also realized that they couldn't get into our territories anymore because we had enough armies
14:59
there that's it okay cool what did you have to say
15:06
Ernest sorry for silencing you as a clarification just would you describe it
15:11
more of a circumstance like a relationship of circumstance
15:18
i guess yeah cool
15:25
well was it the fact that England was more of a pressing
15:31
threat that you didn't try and sneak in behind their lines and maybe grab Tunis
15:37
while they were distracted
15:43
i don't think we consider that i see yeah besides that would be kind of hard
15:50
with three fleets bordering it I think
15:55
all right so basically you had no intention of
16:01
stabbing the situational alliance with you in Italy
16:06
no i find that quite fascinating it's like two siblings working together who
16:12
have bickered endlessly yeah i think that's beautiful in a way
16:18
that you spent seven eight years now fighting and now you guys are holding
16:25
hands almost
16:32
moving on to the next phase you successfully get breast back good this is what an accomplishment
16:39
the other thing is there's very clearly
16:45
several misorders in in England's
16:50
repertoire like how do you feel about them moving out of Belgium
16:57
oh yeah we were like really happy about that one we were also just like confused
17:03
i remember texting about like hm like why did they do this like what was their motivation and we were just like really
17:09
confused yeah i think they think that we would have used a fleet to move into
17:16
breast instead of picky because then if that happened their attack would have
17:21
happened successfully and they would have kept breast but instead we outsmarted them so Belgium technically
17:28
remained ours yeah and
17:34
also very good very pro- France thing that's happening here italy is moving
17:41
away from your territory how do you feel about that
17:46
close you're happy yeah it's not much else but yeah
17:53
so the other unfortunate thing that happened here uh Munich is forced to
17:59
retreat back into Burgundy were you expecting to keep that center
18:05
or or something else um I think I remember that day i was
18:11
talking with Mac and Ove during lunch and then I was like "Oh Mac can I talk
18:17
to you in private?" And then that made Ove suspicious and I think we originally
18:22
had plans to hold Munich or have him help us hold Munich i
18:28
think I guess he decided on against that because he thought we were stabbing him or helping the Italians yeah what would
18:36
a French stab on Russia look like that's what's got me confused or like that we
18:42
would be telling Italy to go after Russia which to be fair I actually did but
18:50
what's the motivation behind that Sean it was like anything to get the Italians out of the Mediterranean
19:01
McKenna was already thinking that but yeah what was your reasoning behind holding
19:09
Marseilles was that negotiated or was that an accident yeah it was yeah that that is a good
19:15
point because there was that chance that that fleet in Western Mediterranean could have moved to the south coast of
19:22
Spain and you could have tried bouncing that but instead you chose to
19:30
hold i think we did consider that but then I think I think I like I forgot to
19:36
like do that or something i don't know
19:41
oh well it ended up working out so it's all good moving on to the next phase you
19:48
get a build hip hip hooray army for France army in
19:53
Paris and the very next move you sneak into North Atlantic and
20:00
Mid-Atlantic Ocean now at this point were you already cuz
20:07
like in the upcoming phase you decide to convoy breast into Liverpool was that
20:12
something you had planned this turn to move that army into Liverpool or was
20:18
that something you realized you could do later
20:23
i think at this point it was our plan right Sean yeah I think we were deciding
20:29
between either that or using the fleets to move in in case we needed to keep our
20:35
uh armies in France it was like an eitheror i think that's very I think this is
20:42
really interesting because I don't believe that I don't believe up until this point
20:49
that many folks had been like thinking with that kind of strategic idea of hey
20:55
in order to like increase our odds in the future we might need to plan out like several several moves in advance
21:04
like so congrats to you guys I think that's a really good thing really good
21:09
Yeah I I think that like that um long-term survival is it's very hard in
21:17
diplomacy because um other countries can switch on a whim
21:22
because of the nature of alliances what is your given what I just said what is your current state of
21:29
alliances and enemies right now has anything changed
21:36
[Music] um I don't think much has changed from
21:41
the last round or two still like neutral with Italy allies with Russia i told OD
21:49
to move Warsaw into LVN to try and take back St petersburg
21:55
um yeah we hoped that they wouldn't convoy into Norway but thankfully that
22:01
didn't happen so he could take St petersburg um I think we tried talking
22:06
to Austria because they had Tyr and Triest right there to take Venice which
22:11
they could have and I don't understand but it's whatever
22:17
why do you think that Austria and Italy were so closely knit together this game
22:28
i honestly have no idea yeah it's like a good question i don't know
22:34
you know cuz yeah they could have like worked with the Russians to take Greece
22:41
or something but I have no idea yeah I remember Austria telling us that
22:47
like they had leverage over Italy which is why Italy would was never like going was never doing anything to them but I
22:54
don't know why Austria never went on the offensive yeah and Austria had like so many
23:01
chances yeah yeah I remember one turn where it was like they had Tyr and Triest and then like they could have
23:08
like moved into Venice and Rome but like they didn't so unfortunate how things
23:15
don't always go your way yeah their loss
23:22
now oh my god how Okay how do you feel about this turn your set of moves right
23:28
here
23:38
it was pretty good we successfully got into Liverpool um they tried to attack Breast
23:44
which bounced us out which is kind of annoying but other than that we kind of
23:50
like predict Oh the Italian fleet was kind of annoying
23:55
yeah i think this was around the time where like uh we as a group decided that we're
24:02
going to end the game on Friday and then Nathan told us that McKenna just let him do whatever so he just tried to grab as
24:08
many territories as possible yeah what else is What else is a
24:14
struggling Italy supposed to do i mean like I feel like they've been
24:21
stuck between a rock and a hard place the entire game yeah
24:27
but hey this year actually marks a very important turning point I think in your
24:33
progression as a nation as a country because you're no longer fighting over Belgium you're now taking the English
24:40
homeland the Norman conquest as it
24:46
will right here in their backyard did you did you feel any significant shift
24:52
after this move that you guys made [Music]
24:59
no I Yeah because we knew we could take Edinburg in the next year
25:06
this just like overall felt like we were in like a much stronger place
25:12
did England try to contact you when this happened or after this happened nope no
25:18
I just remember us but like I think before right before this move was made I
25:24
remember us like taunting them i think it was at like beach day or like something like that and we were just like taunting Amber and that felt nice
25:31
it did was this before um was this was this when we played volleyball
25:38
it might have been cuz I remember when I was sending you guys both home you guys were plotting
25:44
something so maybe Yeah anyway
25:50
so um in our interview with ODve he actually
25:56
congratulated you on this convoy which I think was I think was very funny but he
26:02
also congratulated the English on their convoy to Leavonia here is this a move
26:09
you saw coming or were you surprised when you saw it oh yeah i didn't see the convoy because
26:15
and that is not good news because that means they would lose St petersburg
26:21
again yeah and then Yeah sometimes the English
26:26
moves are like pretty hit or miss that's that's everyone's moves Sean it's
26:32
not just it's not just like like in that last turn or the last
26:38
last turn where they bounce themselves out of Denmark for no reason or like the
26:43
move out of Belgium into Pickard like sometimes they're like really smart with their moves or sometimes it's
26:50
like why did that now well you'll be able to see their whole
26:56
thought process later when I give you access to the raw footage yeah you'll be you'll be able to see why they did that
27:04
anyways we're on to the final phases of the game you have six centers England
27:11
has eight Austria has five and Italy has four while Russia has 11
27:18
while Russia is your ally did you feel any sort of animosity
27:25
towards because Do you feel any animosity towards them because they were in the lead or were you completely fine
27:32
with letting them run wild yeah it's fine with that we just wanted
27:39
to like we just wanted to get like second or third or at least I did
27:46
yeah especially when like the game was ending he was just like "Okay." Like I
27:51
felt like at least England won't win that's how I felt yeah and we weren't in like a position
27:58
to like really hurt Russia i think you could have taken Munich you could have there's you never
28:05
know you'll never know the branches or opportunities that you could have taken
28:10
unless you did take them but unfortunately it's not the case
28:16
so your plans this year i'm guessing they were quite simple get territory
28:23
keep territory you were obviously going to try and go for Inbor but what were
28:28
your plans for protecting everything else you had
28:35
i think we just wanted to play it safe make sure Spain stays ours Marseilles
28:41
stays ours Breast stays ours and then Liverpool and North Atlantic were used
28:46
for offense to take another center before the game ends yeah
28:53
moving on to the next phase now there's a couple things that happen here that
28:59
are quite interesting I'd say first off Italy again fails to turn in orders
29:06
which Well yeah you're laughing uh yeah why' you find that so humorous
29:13
was this Thursday when this happened i think this was Thursday this was Thursday i think I was talking to them
29:19
that day like I think I was talking to Mac and Nathan like right after had ended because I was getting a
29:26
ride from them and we were like literally discussing diplomacy and then
29:32
the fact that like a few hours later I found out they didn't turn in orders was just really funny to me because I was
29:37
like guys we were just talking about it but yeah it I mean didn't affect us so
29:47
in the end it all works out I suppose the Another interesting thing Russia decides
29:52
to do whatever the hell he's doing in Smyrna
29:58
oh yeah i was like why'd you just try to move across the entire map he was like
30:05
oh it's kind of funny clearly it was but there was I don't
30:10
think there's that much to comment on necessarily but okay so I don't know if
30:15
you've noticed this but Austria's been putting up quite the fight against Russia over here do you respect that or
30:22
is it just some sort of nuisance that Russia has to deal with that you're like
30:27
whatever
30:32
i think for me kind of both that they're like still trying but at the same time I think like since the start of the game I
30:39
was like I just want another country w like wiped off the map
30:46
it's fun to see empires fall no would it have been So then would it have been fun to see the Russian Empire fall
30:55
um I guess yeah but not really because it wouldn't
31:01
have helped us in any way because we can't take their territories i guess this is true moving on to the
31:09
last and final phase you successfully take your you successfully take your
31:15
English center and unfortunately you don't have to do much else you're not obligated
31:23
to but you never know you could have you could have tried something with Mut here
31:29
you could have asked Austria for support into it that would have been funny but seeing as this is the last
31:37
round of the game was there anything that you did that you would have done different
31:43
knowing what you know now
31:50
like in general um
32:01
like in this season specifically or in general in general
32:09
I think in the beginning of the game maybe don't try to take like three centers in the first year because it
32:16
kind of put a big target on our back yeah I agree and like people were just
32:21
like more hesitant to trust us i feel like after that
32:26
and then if we had moved faster against the
32:34
Italians I guess um other than
32:41
that I don't really know i guess we figured out it's a lot easier
32:46
to break into England than it is Italy [Laughter]
32:52
you think betrayal especially when they like left yeah you you keep
32:59
h keep go go ahead oh you finish your like I said especially since like
33:05
England left their entire like homeland like like undefended
33:10
mhm yeah well go ahead Ernest go ahead Ernest do you think that betraying is better than
33:17
building alliances i think you need like a balance like I
33:25
think that the alliances are very necessary that being said I think if I
33:31
were to go back I maybe would have chosen for us to go against England a little bit
33:37
earlier but I think it was still necessary for us to have that long alliance with them
33:45
yeah I think having one long alliance partner is really helpful especially one
33:51
that's like close to you but yeah
33:58
Russia was the country that won this game do you think that they deserve to
34:04
win this game was it a well-earned victory
34:11
i would say so yeah he he did a lot of talking
34:18
yeah and Yeah and it was like he was like up and down like all the time like
34:26
I think he lost the most centers and gained the most centers the most or the
34:31
most often yeah so like he like battled his way back a lot yeah ow definitely
34:37
worked for it how would you classify
34:44
okay oh hold on let's just do a status update on everybody so Austria right
34:52
they once had seemingly the world at their feet but now at the end of the
34:58
game they're left with only three home senators to call their own how do you feel about their fall and
35:06
do you think that maybe maybe they could have in a
35:12
different reality taken this taken their fight to Russian homeland instead
35:24
i don't know i think they were like doing pretty well at first but
35:30
then they somehow caused us England and Russia to turn
35:36
against them they couldn't keep a foothold in central
35:42
Europe and then they started kind of losing everything after that so I don't know like specifically what
35:49
they could have done actually I know what they could have done better they could have invaded the Italians
35:56
what do you think would have been different if they had invaded the Italians
36:02
i think just maybe some more breathing room and more armies to like put up a
36:09
defense against Russia because once Russia got like armies surrounding like
36:15
Galacia and they got into like they were fighting over Romania the entire time
36:20
but like once Russia got Romania and like Turkey it was kind of over for the Austrians
36:27
maybe a little bit more breathing room for the Austrians so
36:33
Italy did not advance past five centers in this game how unfortunate do you think that
36:41
they could have done something different to achieve a different outcome
36:50
um same answer but vice versa yeah i think they were too focused on us for
36:56
too long yeah and then yeah they could have I remember
37:03
like during the early couple years of the game if they just helped like Turkey
37:10
and Russia like everyone could have gotten a share of Austria and then
37:15
everybody wins but that didn't happen
37:21
unfortunate and last but not least England
37:26
what do you think England could improve upon and do you have any regrets concerning your relationship with theirs
37:42
yeah I think I think Odday was right we like we like helped them grow too powerful because we literally got them
37:48
into like into mainland Europe and then they got like everything else out of Germany while we like didn't get like
37:55
anything because we were preoccupied with the Italians so like I'd say like their eight centers was kind of like
38:03
like on us like we helped them get
38:12
that do you have anything to say about that Elena yeah I would agree with that
38:19
i think if we were to do it again we shouldn't have helped them grow
38:26
and we maybe should have like torn apart that lines a little bit quicker
38:33
so what would you say you're the most proud of in this
38:40
game what was the move the action like a specific moment that you are especially
38:48
happy happened or especially proud of
38:54
i was really happy when we took back breast and when we got into Liverpool
39:00
because I think that like for like a few rounds we were like really nervous about
39:06
what England was going to do to us and we were just like kind of like on our toes and then when they did go when they
39:15
did kind of backstab backstab us we were able to defend ourselves pretty well
39:24
do you think diplomacy is more fun than when you're recovering
39:29
from disaster scenarios or do you think it's fun when you're in a commanding position
39:43
i think commanding well actually what Elena just described was
39:48
like that was pretty satisfying and like turning it around on them but I think commanding is
39:54
also a lot more fun because you know you feel like you have power you know and
40:01
then like I think like my our favorite my favorite moment was like when we kind of
40:07
orchestrated the downfall of Germany even though I felt really bad afterwards it was like a happy
40:15
your own unit mates oh well that was Tony's fault you know she never wanted
40:20
to ally with us so oh well
40:26
and then we turned our enemy which was England into our ally and then yeah you
40:31
know what that if anything that's your theme you turned your Italian enemy into an Italian situationship
40:42
situationship okay cuz they weren't really friends they weren't really friends but they weren't really enemies
40:48
you know do you mean friend of me Kenan okay situationship is like cuz I think
40:54
that situationship was a little bit maybe wrong yeah yeah yeah i get I get it
41:03
if you were to continue this game
41:09
what would be your next
41:16
step oh interesting um I think south coast of
41:22
Spain moves into west Marseilles into south coast of
41:29
Spain and Burgundy into Marseilles um breast would
41:38
hold and then maybe is that Yorktown or to Wales
41:45
and actually I don't I don't know what to do with the England part but next steps would be to try and
41:51
take Tunisia I think so you would go So you'd basically just attack everywhere
41:59
yeah kind of the Anaconda plan oh wait don't we get a
42:05
build after this turn you did get a build you can only build in one place though Paris and that's an army
42:12
yeah that kind of sucks well okay ernest do you have anything
42:18
else you'd like to ask um one final thought
42:26
how what would your plan be in the Mediterranean given this state of the board if you were to play this like a
42:32
normal diplomacy game like if we were to start over if you
42:38
were to play the game from this position what would you do in
42:45
Would you still remain friends with Italy or would you pursue a different path
42:52
i mean we're not friends at this point they Yeah they were attacked by Italy last phase ernest well I mean all they
42:59
did was just attack but with like no support
43:05
they broke them demilitarized zone and but active aggression because they can
43:11
attack two centers well would you forgive them or would you
43:16
attack back i mean
43:22
yeah like if the game wasn't over I think we might talk to them but
43:28
if if you were to continue this game how would you manage the threat of Russia
43:34
outright winning with 18 centers
43:40
[Music] i don't know maybe support the Austrians
43:45
into Munich per chance oh that would be interesting fancy i like fancy and damn it I wish
43:55
that we were able to continue cuz seeing that happen would have been just plain epic man seeing justice done to Russia
44:03
yes they got away you know what i love Audrey he's great he's an amazing player
44:08
but he got away with way too much he's gotten he I'm surprised that you guys
44:14
let him do his thing because it's Yeah I would have I would have right as soon as
44:19
I realized what he was doing because the the usual course of action in any diplomacy game is that the leading
44:26
player gets absolutely gobsmacked like dogged on relentlessly
44:32
even after they get downsized it is quite the skill to maintain that
44:39
dominant power status and still make sure that nobody's attacking
44:45
you so props to Ove but like it should have been impossible guys you have no And props to you guys for making a
44:51
commanding like a a really commanding position out of fighting a near infinite
44:57
war out of Italy it's like a fairy tale right normally when states or nations are forced into
45:06
these wars of attrition they don't come out better than they were coming into
45:12
it so I guess I have one last
45:18
question in the end was this experience worth it
45:25
yeah yeah i think at times I was like this is consuming too much of my life
45:31
and I was like I just want to talk with like my unit or something
45:37
but I'll like I'll take this to college and me and Ove will scheme in our dorms
45:43
that's nice that's nice yeah I I agree and I feel like it was
45:51
especially like for our like last month or two of like senior year when we
45:56
weren't like doing too much i think it was like a nice sense of like purpose like I remember in lit we wouldn't do
46:04
that much in class but like that was the period when I would like negotiate with people because Jessica Selene and Obe
46:12
were in that class so like it was just like a nice thing to have
46:19
all right and it brought me closer with Elena so a
46:25
I'm glad we got to do that that's That's actually really sweet guys diplomacy doesn't break friendships it creates
46:31
stronger friendships you have six people and you make more friends with one
46:38
okay you mentioned that you would be willing to play this again but I doubt that you meant anytime
46:46
soon i'm guessing so realistically like when
46:52
would you play this again if that's something you want to do i mean low key I'm kind of jobless right
46:59
now but but like I wouldn't play this like over the summer because you don't see
47:04
people every day mhm i feel like this like the way we played it like where we like have one day phases is a lot more
47:11
fun than like doing it in a single day because like a lot can happen backstage
47:17
yeah I agree i'd say college yeah I'm super glad I got you guys hooked
47:24
that was my plan all along do you have any questions for us my
47:29
friends [Music]
47:43
what was your like biggest surprise of this game there was a lot of surprises
47:48
man but truly the most surprised I got was when
47:54
I realized how much everybody was pouring into this game cuz like honestly looking at everybody
48:02
and we the people i love all you guys and I knew you guys were all really
48:07
really smart and just like really cool people so I I assumed that a lot of you
48:14
would have like just a lot more important business to attend to unless you wouldn't dedicate your a lot of your
48:19
time to this diplomacy thing that this random little guy and we the people introduced you to so it really it was a
48:26
pleasant no it was a pleasant surprise when
48:32
everybody started like really getting into it yelling at each other over simple things her iPad died i see she'll
48:41
rejoin in a minute okay but yeah like I think one of the
48:46
highlights was England Russia and Austria duking it out
48:52
in Central Europe cuz that was that was the period where the most intrigue was
48:59
happening and everybody was yelling at each other they were pressuring you you
49:04
and Italy to make peace like everybody was trying their hardest and that's
49:09
where the magic of diplomacy comes in playing this game online with people
49:15
that you don't know or sometimes even in person in one day people end up losing
49:24
interest very quickly and at that point the game loses its magic it's only when
49:30
everybody is truly going for the win and are truly acting in their best interest
49:36
that this game becomes just the best so thank you guys
49:43
cuz I would you may you guys manage a bunch of people who've never played this
49:48
game before managed to create a game that I really wish that I was a part of like I played in so props to you guys
49:55
i'm glad that I even got to like see it and listen to your thoughts at all thank
50:00
you thank you thank you i'll I'll echo Keenan in a very similar
50:06
light i think like seeing the emotion was probably the most like best part of
50:12
the game for me since it's the emotion is very removed as an online player cuz
50:20
you're just talking with a bunch of boxes and names and usernames you don't
50:25
get to really see like the personality aspect you have to infer a lot more than
50:32
if it was in person like here so I think that like the most there was a moment
50:38
when I realized that um you guys like were really like a lot
50:45
of you had so much interest in this little game that you know usually
50:53
um it's hard for people to care about echoing Kanan and I thank you for that for
51:00
making it such an awesome experience to game master and listen to your internal thoughts
51:05
thoughts and I think I won't forget it at all i hope
51:12
you guys won't forget it either you won't
51:19
any last remaining questions oh wait one more what was the the MVP
51:25
move of the game mvp move of the game what oh that's hard there's a there's
51:31
like a plethora to choose from i think we can isolate She was like top three or something hold on hold on wait i'm gonna
51:36
need to I'm gonna need to figure this out because there are All right wait let's see here okay for me it's not I
51:44
don't think diplomacy can be summed up in one move so one of my favorite bits
51:49
was near the start because it was really unconventional it was between actually
51:55
you guys Amber and Jessica and Tanvi and Harini like it it all concerns Belgium
52:02
right this happened in like the first two years first Germany supports you into
52:08
Belgium england is pissed what happens the next time we have to
52:16
move oh please load it's not but basically what happens next germany
52:23
moves into Belgium with English support france is pissed and then the next
52:30
move England is supported into Belgium with French support and Germany is
52:35
pissed like that is so funny in a very brief amount of time the alliance
52:42
structure had shifted again and again and again where each side was each side
52:47
was cheering each side was like graveling at each other's feets it's so
52:52
funny this is that's one of my favorite bits of this game yeah it's like a bunch of petty little
52:59
kings fighting over a single plot of land this case Belgium do you have a
53:05
favorite move Ernest um it would have to be in the middle game uh I forgot which
53:12
year you're talking about was it
53:18
um no not this one this one was good too oh this one's interesting this one's a good candidate because it's a backstab
53:26
it's a backst step from England um
53:33
this I like this move too because surprisingly there is a lot of there's a lot of weight to this first this English
53:41
ke I mean you were part of this right england and you decided to support
53:47
Russia into Munich instead of supporting you into Munich when this happened Austria got more mad
53:55
at England for supporting Russia in the Munich instead of Russia who also took
54:02
Romania i think that's hilarious and there was so much yelling that happened here it was so fun it was and I missed
54:10
all of it because I think this was during AP Physics testing week so I was
54:15
like in the test room as it happened
54:20
but if to make it interesting I think one of my favorite moves pertaining to
54:26
specifically you guys was this whole this whole sequence happening with you and Italy because
54:33
despite Marseilles being captured like you guys had a level head about it and
54:38
you knew that instead of trying to take Marseilles you should try and position to take it next year or the next turn
54:45
that's smart that's good that foresight is um is important i think that lots of
54:53
players forget certain provinces in the core of the map such as NAF or Syria and
54:59
I see there that you've actually moved to NAF which uh I haven't seen in a good
55:06
while so props to you guys for using um
55:12
underrepresented corners of the map elena do you have any questions for us
55:19
[Music] um if the game lasted longer do you
55:24
think that like the results would have stayed the same like would Russia have won or do you think that
55:31
it's really it's really hard to say because it's it's very situational what could and what couldn't have happened
55:39
for Russia to lose you would need to not go after Italy i think I think you would
55:44
need to leave Italy alone so that they can help Austria take out Russia
55:49
mhm for you to win it would be continue like kicking England's ass and also
55:57
trying to kick Russia's ass a little bit too because there is a route for you to win this
56:03
and I mean technically there's a route for England to win this and if the game was allowed to drag on longer Italy
56:10
could have won this like really it all depends mhm but if I had to say with
56:18
like with like odds in mind Russia would probably win if you guys like
56:25
miscalculated misplayed or something like that
56:31
also they would lose Moscow in the next turn right oh wait no they would get builds never mind they have Yeah they
56:37
have they have one build so they would be able to protect Moscow
56:45
so I don't know and I would have loved to see a game where this Russia fell because it
56:53
could happen there's a lot of potential the best part about this sports state is really it's not decisive at all it could
57:00
be anyone's game yeah unlike chess where one person gets
57:05
an advantage and holds it forever less they blunder here you have seven or now
57:12
five so people who want to win so we've reached this point this might be the
57:17
last time you talk about diplomacy with your weeple people guys does that upset you are you glad this
57:24
game has ended no it's sad well I mean we might host another thing
57:30
so you never know make make it an annual thing i don't know about that dude annual competition diplomacy
57:38
we'll have to see about that we'll feel around there for a little bit and if you ever do manage to get a
57:44
game going with your friends or just someone else let me know let me join i'd
57:50
love to play with you guys okay definitely thank you thank you so
57:56
much for playing i can't believe that this turned out as well as I thought it would go yeah thank you for hosting yes
58:04
thank you guys for hosting you guys were super helpful with understanding the game oh thanks i'm glad we could be of
58:12
