0:00
so it seems like we are on a little bit of a time crunch So why don't we uh get
0:05
this started right now Coming into this game did you guys have any initial
0:12
strategy or plan And if you did what was it
0:18
It was mostly just trying to like expand without like attacking other countries
0:25
at the moment like we realized we could take Spain and Portugal easily and then
0:31
hopefully keep Belgium out of anyone's hands So that was like for our first very first move I
0:38
guess Yeah Like I didn't really have any like particular strategy but I was like
0:43
watching like YouTube videos on the game to like understand it a little bit more And I was like reading through the
0:49
comments and I remember this there was this one comment that said like don't make like enemies like too quickly or
0:54
like too easily or like choose very very wisely when you want to do that and
0:59
that's like really the only thing that I kind of like kept in mind like since the beginning So do you think that strategy
1:06
had flaws or has it worked out all right so far I think the strategy was right because
1:14
or I think it was also a mistake on my part that like we tried to be well
1:20
England didn't like communicate with us for a while after like the first order
1:26
or something so we thought they ghosted us and they could move the fleet in the
1:32
English channel to like wide open breast Mhm We quickly concluded with the
1:37
Germans to help us take Belgium I guess that was like a mistake because like
1:43
that just painted a really large target on our backs having six armies Yeah
1:52
So it made the English kind of hate us but Okay Yeah But we're working on repairing that Do you think Oh yeah We
1:58
need to like park them afterwards Elena Oh yeah Yeah Do you think that you could successfully repair that bridge or is it
2:05
something you guys don't think you could come back from We're trying right now I think I think
2:12
it could happen Otherwise it might mean our defeat What do you plan on doing to
2:21
sway them to your side I've been like reading articles and I
2:26
realized that like good players like make other countries feel good about
2:31
themselves by maybe even conceding territories And I think that's what
2:37
we're trying to do right now and actually prove that we could help
2:42
them in alliance while like hopefully like secretly like making oursel putting ourselves in
2:49
better positions along the way What would you Sorry Go ahead Elena Oh I was just going to say like I think that
2:55
there is like possible redemption just because that was like the first Was that the first or the second play Like that
3:01
was just like really early on So I think that Yeah second So I think that there's possible ways to make it seem
3:09
like oh my gosh like we were just like we were just like you know what I mean Like it wasn't like this intentional
3:14
long thing like oh my gosh like you know what I mean So I think that cute dog
3:20
Sorry He says "Hi."
3:25
Cute Um I think there's hope I believe but I also have
3:31
not read their last messages so I don't know They could have been telling us to screw off So what what specifically do
3:36
you have in mind when it comes to conceding territory
3:45
Um not sure yet We're still trying to figure out because it's our like first
3:50
time Um I guess it's just to make sure like it's like a like a trust building
3:56
exercise but also making sure to station our troops so as to like when we concede
4:02
it won't mean that it leaves them an opening to then betray that and then just move in
4:09
and wipe us out Yeah my brother just came in right now
4:16
I'm in a meeting We're gonna have cake for my birthday Sorry Quincy This needs that needs to wait I'm so sorry
4:26
Okay As you can see very busy day I've been celebrating my brother's birthday throughout Anyway happy birthday Tim
4:33
Yeah they say happy birthday Okay so that's also why we're a little
4:39
bit on a time crunch so we got to we got to speed it up a bit So I think it's quite obvious to see
4:45
that a lot of your neighbors are not too happy with you Out
4:51
of out of the rest of the players though who do you think would be your better ally And which of the players attacking
4:59
you is currently enemy number one I mean I feel like currently like our
5:07
lowkey bestie like friendnemy is like Russia Would you agree Sean Yeah cuz
5:14
like we have to help each other like because Germany is trying to expand both ways and it's like in our best interest
5:21
Plus
5:29
Audree with that claim but I think the rest of it I agree with I can see why
5:35
like Oddbe got was eliminated He like mentioned before that he played
5:40
diplomacy before I can see why he got out the first He was why he was
5:46
eliminated first because he's too good of a person Well he has not yet been
5:52
eliminated Let's not hold our breath here for too long What about the other side of the spectrum Who do you think
5:58
out of the three people that are currently hostile to you is the worst enemy
6:04
Italy Like Elena your thoughts I don't know I mean my mind immediately went to
6:10
England but I want to see why you think Italy because I think that before what
6:15
what was it What month Like what season was it Spring or something I think spring I would have said it was Italy too Why do you think it's Italy right
6:21
now too Because it's from day one like we didn't know how to like play the game So the
6:29
only country we talked to was England And then whenever Mac like tried to approach I was just and like asked what
6:35
we were planning and we were just like I don't know because like I guess I acted a little shady but I also just like
6:41
genuinely didn't know And I was reading articles that said like players who are
6:47
like guarded like that usually means that they're going to attack you So I guess Mac thought we were going to
6:52
attack them and then so she I guess she just like started moving in and like
7:00
every turn we were like convincing Italy that there are better options but they
7:06
were just like like stonewall like unreceivable and they're just and honestly I don't see how they could
7:13
break into France right now I was just talking with Aud too and like
7:18
it just like it doesn't work they there's not enough it doesn't work because we have enough armies and fleets to defend the southern border of France
7:26
from Italian attack So I don't know what's why they're so persistent and
7:31
they're like completely unwilling to move east into Turkey I mean Austria
7:41
So why did you think it was England Elena just because I feel like I agree with
7:47
Sean in the sense that like yeah like literally immediately like the first day that we started I remember people like
7:54
telling me like yeah like Italy Italy wants to get get you guys like Italyy's targeting you guys But I think like now
8:00
because we kind of burned the bridge of England I feel like there's more of like
8:06
a like a fire under their butts and kind of more of that like vehement like they
8:11
want to like get us a little bit But yeah Italy Italy is a good answer also
8:19
So I would argue that earlier in the game when you had six centers that you
8:26
would be among the largest threats on the board just not only in terms of presence but of in terms of
8:32
influence Who do you think is now the biggest threat with you and Russia on the ropes
8:42
I think because of the German English alliance in the last move and that
8:48
England took over Sweden and Russia doesn't have really any means to fight
8:53
back and that our only hope is England so we could potentially offer them
8:59
support into Germany I think England is the biggest threat
9:05
Yeah I would agree And I think that's really interesting because like I think it was like like last round or the round
9:11
before that where everyone was like "Yeah like I think England's going to be out next." Like England doesn't know how to play the game but now like England's
9:17
like a pretty has a pretty big central role
9:23
Okay So not only are there more forward more like clear bigger threats but
9:28
they're also players that hide in the background that are more sneaky with how they do things And in that way they are
9:35
underestimated Who do you think out of the players here is the most underestimated And
9:46
why I think Austria like
9:52
they managed to not lose any territories and somehow gained a really strong
9:58
alliance with Italy We're going to try and break that down But they have also
10:04
successfully convinced Turkey to I remember when everyone's going to be like "Oh Austria is going to fall um
10:11
with this plan that odd made up." But they somehow convinced both Italy and Turkey to turn
10:18
away and instead focus on the Russians and Italy on um US France So I think
10:25
that they really pulled themselves out of a tight spot I guess by getting Turkey to switch
10:31
out last to switch plans last minute So I think they navigated the situations
10:36
pretty well Yeah that's a good answer I feel like I
10:42
would add on to that like Russia just because essentially my answer is just
10:48
like Ove period Like I will never underestimate Ove He scares me and I
10:54
think that he could like secretly kill us all What is
11:00
it Okay All right It's got to be a Weeple quote A
11:06
will secretly kill us all Well all this there seems to be like a lot of Ove
11:12
animosity Not only No I love Ove This scares me No I mean I mean in in the
11:18
context of this game obviously not like in real life the where do you think that comes from Why do you have this gut
11:25
reaction to fear odd in this game Because Okay I think it's because like
11:32
it's like you specifically asked like who's kind of like underestimated right And I think because like the way that
11:38
talks especially like to me I feel like he does it in a way where like I immediately like want to like trust him
11:45
and like that makes me suspicious if that makes sense Like the fact that like do you know what I mean He's too
11:50
trustworthy Yeah It's like this is weird Like actually trustworthy No Sean See Sean's
11:59
trusting him That's like No like every every single like piece of intel I've
12:05
like we've had together is like true Like he's actually telling the truth
12:10
Like unlike when like Mac and Nathan like straight up lie to our faces And I think that call actually helped that
12:18
like I can I can hopefully now tell like if people are lying or not Yeah Facts
12:23
That's actually really true What do you think is the greatest tell for when somebody is lying Sean
12:32
I think that when they're just like there needs to be like
12:40
um what's the term or like how to say it Like people need to receive something in
12:46
order to do something Like if people are just agreeing to
12:51
something without a specific plan um there needs to be clear like mo a
12:57
motivation motivation to why they do it So like if there's no motivation behind it then it's not really
13:06
um you can't expect they'll like follow through Yeah Yeah
13:12
When you were on the top of the world last turn you had your six centers and
13:19
you thought everything was going well Did you have a sinking suspicion or did you already sort of know that things
13:27
were about to go from good to bad
13:33
I feel like we were scared that it was going to go bad
13:39
in terms of like Italy and like them coming for us At least I was not
13:45
expecting like England to be the one that kind of like got us
13:51
Just this last one Quincy I'll be done in like 15 minutes Sorry Go on ahead
13:57
My turn Um I think the we made like like two or
14:03
three big mistakes and I think other than like being too greedy in our first turn and taking three centers when we
14:09
were on top of the world I think that like harmed us by putting like a large target on our backs but also second when
14:16
we convinced Germany to support us into Belgium and then we didn't offer something in return so they kind of got
14:24
salty about that and like revengeful And that's the mistake I missed And also
14:30
I did not see the because of that I didn't see the English uh German
14:35
alliance that pushed us out of Belgium Like I accounted for I like ran through
14:41
all the situations of what could happen except for that one Yeah
14:52
So if you do not manage to convince England to again help you out or
14:59
convince England to let you help them out do you see yourself any sort of
15:05
scenario where you can come back from this position or do you think all hope is lost
15:19
Um I would say maybe not all hope is lost
15:26
Um well if Audrey is right and Germany isn't lying and double twisting
15:31
supposedly they're Oh I forgot to tell London this but supposedly they're moving all they're retreating everything
15:38
back to where they came from So it should leave an opening back for Belgium
15:44
And now that I like I thought through the situations in the southern area I
15:50
don't think Italy could successfully um attack the southern France because we
15:58
have just enough armies um to hold them off
16:03
Wait Sean just to like clarify Wait so we were supposed to retreat out of Belgium but now they're going to retreat
16:09
out of Belgium I think So well I'm not sure about
16:15
Belgium but they're retreating They're they're they advanced two armies out of
16:21
uh Munich and um and Berlin and they're retreating
16:27
back into those because they realize they can't move all the way into Russia Oh okay Okay Got you What do you So do
16:37
you plan to try and make a move for Belgium yourself or to support England into Belgium
16:46
I don't know with this new information about Germany like retreating I I think it still could be beneficial to help the
16:53
English into Belgium but that would give them three like new armies this turn if
17:00
they like if we if they follow through on the plan which could give them a lot of power Mhm But I don't know We'll have
17:09
to like discuss more tonight to see What do you think What do you plan to do with
17:15
your fleet in MAO Because I would argue that is a very
17:21
important fleet It can either go south or it could do something to England Do you have any specific plans for that in
17:28
mind I was thinking of moving it
17:35
um either attacking the fleet in west or moving it to North Africa to like scare
17:43
Italy into thinking Yeah But honestly if we do lose Belgium
17:49
this turn I think like in my opinion I don't I don't know about Alena's that that might be the army that we have to
17:55
give up The one in Belgium Uh the one in the Mid-Atlantic Oh okay
18:04
Because we kind of need um Marseilles and Gaskani to hold off
18:09
Italy and Burgundy too Um Breast needs to stay and then I think Pickerty needs
18:16
to stay just in case the English move in Yeah I would agree with that
18:23
Okay So what is the most important thing for you guys to do moving forward
18:35
I think just to learn from our mistakes and be more at least at least for me to
18:41
be more nice when talking I guess instead of saying
18:47
you're all going to die with this move or something And I don't know like we
18:53
need to actually build we need to build stronger alliances instead of seeming as
18:59
such a big threat on the board that we just slowly slowly work towards the long
19:05
game Yeah I was like literally going to say the same thing I think like strategy wise just like building
19:12
alliances and like in a weird way making ourselves seem a little bit
19:19
meek like I think there can be like a little bit of like a manipulative factor
19:24
in that and I think that I don't know I feel like that could work in some ways
19:30
especially because some players have felt like a little bit threatened by us So
19:36
how would you how would you look Meek Um like just in the way that you talk to
19:43
them like like I feel like we kind of and I think other players did too Like
19:48
other countries underestimated like England a little bit And I don't know if I don't think England did this on
19:54
purpose Like I don't think they were trying to like make themselves seem like not knowledgeable but I think
20:03
somehow they did And I think that kind of worked their favor and like weirdly enough I think that that could be kind
20:09
of like a strategy I don't know I feel like in the real world sometimes people like underestimate others and then like
20:16
they don't realize it when we undercut them So do you think that you can use similar
20:23
rhetoric in next year when people build new units of somebody being too big that
20:30
they are too large now in order to challenge the existing alliance structure of today of the presence
20:38
Yeah I think we need to be more of a supporting factor rather than a dominating factor in order to like make
20:45
people like us more so that they're more willing to work with us to more
20:52
to benefit each other more
20:57
Ernest do you have any questions Um did we touch on like how to defend
21:04
against Spain and Portugal
21:09
like the invasion of how to how to keep those territories Well yeah the more pressing concern is
21:17
Spain and Italy's fleet in west So I think Gaskani moves back into Spain I
21:25
don't think Portugal needs to be defended at the moment Um
21:32
Wait Yeah because we have like the fleet and MAO too right So I think that could
21:38
be a helpful factor In your eyes do you think that you
21:44
should befriend your foes and make foes out of your friends
21:53
Yes And I think the most beneficial foe to be turned friend would be
21:58
England And I think Italy is they've been like day one hard stuck on us for
22:04
some reason Even though we didn't I think I think like m like McKenna like
22:12
maybe thinks like she's like really experienced in this game or something but we were just like we just didn't know what we were doing So that's why we
22:17
only like I guess shrug them off a little bit
22:23
So why do you see a scenario where you instead ally with Germany
22:33
We're not sure because the last time we tried to talk to them kind of yeah that didn't really
22:40
like work a little I think trust is kind of fallen there and they're very
22:47
like they're very they're very held back in our every time we talk Yeah What do
22:54
you mean by held back or back not willing to share anything So
23:02
like we're like we're generally like more open people like even in like real life
23:12
in this in this game Tonvi and Harini are like very held back with their moves
23:19
I think that's a possible sign We could work on that but I think it
23:24
might be a sign that I don't know maybe Germany is not it and England is a better play maybe
23:32
So we've touched base on roughly all of the countries We've talked about England we've talked about Germany Italy Austria
23:38
Russia but we have not really talked about Turkey What are your thoughts on
23:45
that country Do you think that they are formidable or can they be pushed aside as another side character in this ward
24:02
Ala we haven't had a lot of interactions with them Like we I think we had like
24:08
one like group conversation with like them and Russia So I'm not really sure like what their plans are or like what
24:14
their mindset really is Um I don't know I don't have like a lot
24:20
of thoughts on that but I do think that would be interesting if they like turned out to be a little bit more like
24:25
dominant in this game I've communicated with Bogia a couple
24:30
times I think like relationships are like amicable and good And I actually
24:36
just texted him earlier [Music] because Ove wanted me to like spread a
24:42
rumor but now it's but now the rumor is actually turning true that uh Austria is
24:48
going to move into Bulgaria Um Whoa That's actually crazy Odd
24:55
spreading misinformation Wait that's actually crazy Guys we need reading to counter that misinformation
25:02
What' you say I said we need some lateral reading to counter that misinformation Oh boy Not lateral
25:08
reading So what makes you think that this Austrian move into Bulgaria is actually real
25:15
We don't I mean it's a it's a good opportunity for the Austrians but you you mentioned that it's a rumor
25:22
that's becoming real that's becoming true or that's what Ove said but I
25:28
mostly trust Ove but I think the Austrians could be playing deceit into Ove but yeah but if that happens
25:38
then I don't know what will happen with Turkey I haven't thought of Turkey too
25:47
Do you think they've had a couple um like failed moves if I remember correctly in the
25:53
first or like uh second order and like another order but I think that's just
25:59
like them trying to figure out the game So I think I don't know We're both on like we're both we're both just trying
26:04
to figure things out Do you think it do you think that's something you should work on that you should get to know
26:10
Turkey a little bit more or do you not value that relationship as much as you would England Germany or
26:20
Italy I think like making contact every now and then would be good but maybe not
26:26
as strong as emphasis as England Yeah like I don't think it's our
26:32
priority but I think like I didn't understand at the beginning of the game that like you're kind of supposed to
26:40
talk to like everyone and when I would see people talk I just assume that they were immediately aligned and like had
26:46
alliance but no like you are just kind of supposed to have like open ongoing communication even if it doesn't like
26:52
amount to anything So yeah I think having somewhat of relationship with
26:57
them is important but not of the highest importance
27:03
Do you have any questions Ernest I think we've covered all of it
27:10
Do you have any questions Sorry Go ahead I am interested in how you're going to
27:16
hold Belgium cuz because what you said was
27:22
basically convince them to give it to you back
27:29
Well how are you guys going to do that I think it might mean conceding Belgium
27:37
to the English to like to make them happy and
27:43
like actually be in an alliance that way by offering them uh a supply
27:49
center If what um if what Oddface said is true about Germany and Germany isn't
27:55
lying that they're moving everything back into what they started at the beginning of the year we theoretically
28:01
could take it back by ourselves but that's a that's a chance Yeah that's like an that's an if
28:09
Do you have any questions for us guys
28:14
I don't
28:21
Um I don't think so Not Oh is this your first time playing game master Um well
28:27
yeah I mean I think this is interesting I get a better perspective on what everybody else is thinking you know Yeah
28:35
that's what I was going to ask like how's perspective like shifted to seeing all of this I got to be careful See I
28:42
got to be careful Me and Ernest have to be careful that we ourselves are not players in this game influencing other
28:48
people to do things We have to be very selective in what we say Mhm Has it like taught you stuff
28:55
though or are you like not surprised by anything Oh I
29:00
mean I I think it has like this general like Ove seems to be like a key player
29:07
in this like cuz not a lot of people seem to trust
29:12
him But and I I think that's I think that's an interesting I think that's an interesting study because like what
29:20
makes him non-rustworthy you know and there are other smaller things or larger things
29:26
that are kind of similar to that that aren't as obvious which I will not disclose but yeah it's really interesting and I
29:33
like I like that dynamic of me being like this researcher like just seeing my
29:40
little lab rats seeing how they interact you know
29:46
How is it for you guys playing this game I hope it's I hope you aren't too distraught of your position I hope you
29:52
don't give up because there's always a chance to come back Yeah I think it's like really
29:57
interesting and I'm like a lot like I'm more invested than I thought it would be
30:02
Yeah I was like really invested in the start It felt like we were on top of the world and then last move last move it
30:09
just turned into like everybody against us and then we I started to realize like
30:15
the mistakes we made in the beginning So it's interesting It's also
30:21
like like seeing how your how your friends lie It's always
30:29
it's just like a personal thing that I've like thought of before like Yeah Like you ever like ask someone or your
30:36
friend a question to see if they would lie Sorry I don't know It seems like you should be a game
30:42
master because this is those are the type of questions that get answered when you're in a position like mine and earnests
30:51
Thank you so much for taking 30 minutes of your day to talk to us Thanks for doing this interview We've done so far
30:58

31:12
too long So please go ahead Be good
