0:00
uh why don't we jump straight into it so this is your first game and because it's
0:07
your first game I think it's very important for you to like have some initial plan or strategy coming into it
0:14
what was that for you guys and did your do you think your strategy needs to change
0:21
jula correct me if I'm wrong but we really did not have any type of strategy coming into this
0:27
yeah we mostly just sort of like went in blind we didn't know what we were doing we kind of just went in with the idea
0:33
that we'll figure it out as we go and I think it's been working pretty well so far so what exactly did you guys figure
0:40
out as you were feeling around like you said you came in with no plan but did you formulate one at some point yeah the
0:47
most interesting part was probably when Mac randomly um the second the game was announced texted us being like "Oh
0:53
you're Turkey we're Italy we should talk." nothing else just a message um that was right around it in that message
0:59
and then I got to English the next day and then everyone was talking about alliances and I was like "Oh okay so this is what's happening." Like
1:04
everyone's just already like going right into it fantastic um then I texted Drew
1:10
and I was like "H we might want to start thinking about this sometime soon." But then in English that day um
1:17
Gabe and Mac were talking to me i like "Yeah this seems like a forible
1:23
alliance." Oh and then actually while I was walking to English in that same day Abe also reached out and he's like "Oh
1:29
you bought the same man I wanted like we we should partner." I was like "Okay so everyone's trying to partner with
1:35
everyone which basically means no one's partner with no one so we have to pick allies carefully."
1:42
So I see it was all chaos from that day and eventually you seem to have caught up
1:49
come up on top and at some point it feels like you had to choose your allies
1:55
um why did you choose the allies that you chose yeah so
2:01
um our allies we had like two main options we were either going to ally
2:06
with Russia and that would pit us against Austria and uh Italy or our
2:12
other option was to ally with Austria and Italy and we would go against Russia
2:18
we ended up choosing to ally with Austria and Italy because we found that
2:23
um not only was it geographically more advantageous to us but it also seemed like they would take the alliance more
2:30
seriously as Russia had also been offering uh Austria an option to
2:35
essentially work with them to take our territory over but at the same time they were offering us an alliance to take
2:41
Austria over so it was not clear sort of like where like alliances would probably fall that was like our biggest reasoning
2:47
for choosing to go the way that we did okay so do do you think you've made the
2:56
correct choice now that you have Russia on the ropes
3:02
i definitely think Austria going against Austria would have been the easier choice um because Russia brought up fair
3:10
points it was really easy to take down Austria with the position they had um but I don't it would be advantageous for
3:17
us in the short term we would gain a lot of land initially but the second that happened being allied with Russia didn't
3:23
really mean much cuz then the second Austria was out of the question we would be the next targets so I do think
3:29
working with Austria was the smartest plan there but doesn't the same logic apply but for Russia once Russia is gone
3:36
then doesn't it stop being advantageous to work with Austria i actually wouldn't say so
3:42
because Austria has been very transparent about everything since the start while they have the opportunity to
3:49
backstab us and have had it for multiple different rounds they haven't taken it so that level of trust is a little more
3:56
clear when it comes to Austria than it is with Russia and also the reason this be more
4:03
advantageous for um Austria to not backstab us is because they have an entire portion to the west that they
4:10
would be busy attacking us if we're able to push into Russia then that's on the east side so then they have two battles
4:16
while Russia would have been primarily focused on our end
4:22
well just to be clear when you mean trustworthy or transparent what do you what are you
4:29
looking for i mean for me for example with um Ido as
4:36
we like to call it the alliance between Turkey Austria and Italy we've been
4:42
talking about exactly what orders we plan to make russia's tried to do that but the orders that they plan to make
4:48
and the orders that actually get executed aren't the same which I mean it's a game makes sense why they aren't
4:53
but that does put in that air of uncertainty
4:59
um they are thereby harder to trust
5:05
um but as far as Italy and Austria go at least for the
5:13
short term they seem relatively trustworthy um and we've been able to
5:18
form alliances with them so far so I think it's very interesting that you have a three-way alliance because that
5:26
allows for a more hierarchal dynamic if you were to place each of the countries
5:33
including yourself in your alliance on who has the most influence who has the
5:38
least influence how would you place it i would place all of us on equal ground i'd say that in terms of influence all
5:45
of us have the same amount and we all respect each other to the equal extent
5:50
yeah I'd agree that's very interesting i'm very That's very interesting that you say that because in a three-way
5:58
alliance if you if it does hold up to like a long-term alliance kind of deal
6:04
you're going to have to stab each other earlier than you would a two-person alliance cuz less land will be open for
6:10
you know everybody to share so if you trust everybody and if everybody has the
6:16
same influence when do you think that you'll eventually have to stab your allies and how would you do it
6:25
i would actually think not too far off from now um Italy is facing a decent
6:33
contention on the west front so I they're almost done with what they're
6:38
trying to get from France i think there was going for Marseilles and I'm pretty sure they're going to get that in the next couple rounds and once they do I if
6:46
I were Austria I would be scared also question is this going out anytime soon
6:51
this this interview will be shown with everybody at the end of the game so feel free to voice any of your honest
6:57
thoughts and opinions i see okay yeah i don't know i fear for
7:03
Austria out of all three of us like Italy can't really get to us anytime soon we can't get to Italy anytime soon
7:10
um Austria is kind of just in their sandwich in the middle so if anything does fall apart I think it would be
7:16
Austria who would be the one facing the trouble yeah because the only way that would happen is if US and Italy allied
7:23
against Austria in which case they'd be like sandwiched do you think that scenario you proposed Duva is likely to
7:30
happen not for the short term but maybe like soon
7:36
okay that's a very interesting way of thinking so who do you think right now is the
7:43
biggest threat on the board and why england weren't they the ones with six
7:48
territory no that was France right yeah France was the one with six territories like two rounds ago i think that they
7:55
were the biggest threat just because they were the largest i don't know if that still holds i haven't looked at the
8:01
I would say it's actually Russia because they have been looking like master manipulators recently uh and I mean we
8:09
we we cracked them this last time but we looked at the deal they offered us a
8:15
deal for this round and we're trying to convince us to uh break out of Eido i doubt that they did that with just us
8:22
and they're formidable opponents i think they're really good at making other people want to side with them and so I
8:30
think while they lost a little bit of territory actually well they haven't completely lost it just yet um they
8:36
might be losing territory soon i don't think they're out of the question just yet well it I think it is a fair like
8:45
judgment to make that both France and Russia have been checked by their neighboring powers in such a way that
8:52
they might not be the biggest threat on the board anymore moving on to the future who do you think has the biggest
8:59
prospects in replacing those two as the biggest threat
9:04
i would say that um what is it germany has pretty big prospects looking at it
9:09
like they've been kind of quiet but they're like in the center of everything that's going on i'd say that they have
9:15
very much a possibility of expanding especially if they ally with like either the West or the East they can hold while
9:21
they push forward i would say England because of the exact
9:27
opposite reasons for why I drew us as Germany i think because England is a little more secluded they have one front
9:33
that they have to fight they can come in directly and focus in one direction whereas something like Germany they
9:38
would have to make sure that they're defended all around if they make two moves they are pissing off two separate people whereas Germany or uh England can
9:46
target their attacks a lot more efficiently I would say
9:56
so Ernest do you have any
10:03
questions okay so Ernest does not appear to have any questions i'll continue with my questioning you said that England
10:10
could become the next biggest threat because they can focus more on one front over the other
10:16
but to me it appears that they are not doing that right now that they have
10:21
their front spread fighting both Russia and France at the same time do you mean something else or is
10:28
that fighting on one front i
10:35
think that is most certainly not fighting on one front it is still fighting in one direction which is a little easier than trying to like split
10:41
your troops and like go one way and the other way like they're still fighting in the same or like a similar vicinity um
10:48
it makes it easier to redirect troops in that case but honestly if I were them I would focus completely unilaterally
10:55
especially given their position so that they can expand and then expand funds later on but to each their own so you have
11:04
voiced your opinions on Russia how you think that they are a huge manipulator and that could be a dangerous player um
11:12
what are your thoughts on Austria and how they play the game do they I'd say
11:18
Austria's Sorry go ahead you go ahead and answer the question you basically knew what I was going to ask so go ahead
11:24
okay i think that they're playing the game really smart right now um it seems like they're like very set on being like
11:31
strong allies with us but I feel like they will backstab us like relatively soon and I think that that's something
11:38
that we're going to need to keep an eye out for and I'd say they're playing it smarter than Russia because Russia's manipulation is a little bit too open
11:45
austria they'll get you to trust them for at least like a while before backstabbing you
11:51
yeah I agree especially because Austria is in the dead middle and Russia made it
11:57
very clear that they're going to be the primary target i think um uh making good
12:03
alliances with people who are willing to defend them is critical and I think that's what they've been focusing on
12:12
are you more likely to betray Italy before you betray Austria or is it the
12:19
other way around i think geographically it's the other way around
12:26
though I would say if I had a choice I would rather betray Italy first because I feel
12:31
like Austria and us have both gained an equal amount from the alliance between us two we haven't gained anything from
12:38
being allied with Italy at the moment i agree i I would prefer to betray Italy over Austria just because like I think
12:45
that Austria and US have been working pretty well together but just due to like geographic like situations I don't
12:52
think that it's feasible i would say that your position as Turkey on this map
12:58
is a little bit interesting you have water surrounding all sides of your provinces that your home starting
13:04
provinces right and so clearly there needs to be a balance of fleets and a balance of armies what do you think is
13:11
the correct balance of fleets and the correct balance of armies for you to have moving forward
13:19
i would say as long as we're still in contentions with Russia having a couple of extra armies is going to help um
13:25
because most of the battles with Russia are looking like they're moving northwards which is in land for us but
13:32
as soon as focus shifts off of Russia I think it's going to be really important to have fleets because the only way we
13:37
can then expand is by going around Austria assuming we we still keep our alliance in that scenario um and to do
13:45
that we would need plenty of fleets both for convoys and just attacking
13:53
yeah I agree i think that right now we should focus on having fleets defending us and then just build up our army so we
14:00
could push through on like the one front that we have since it's not since if there's no way to like get out there's
14:05
no way to get in on the other sides if we have fleets blocking so then it would be pretty easy for us to just push in
14:12
push through that like one strip of land that we have available what do you think are the chances that
14:19
Russia the master manipulator successfully manipulates Austria to turn
14:24
on you this turn i don't think that's happening i think I
14:29
think that Russia I think it is a lot more likely that we go against Austria then Austria goes
14:36
against us in this round so is it is that the case merely because
14:43
you think it is more it is more of a temptation for you than it is for
14:48
Austria to attack you austria doesn't gain a lot from taking
14:55
us out like they can expand in the direction that we are but we are in a very landlocked position so going
15:02
further that way is just asking for Russia to invade them which they've already been trying to do for us if we
15:07
take Austria we are moving away from our landlock position so we gain a lot more by allying with Russia than Austria does
15:14
um and that's honestly the only reason I think Austria would rather ally with us than Russia because we can serve against
15:21
Russia which is their biggest enemy right now austria said this many times an enemy of their enemy is their friend
15:27
that is primarily the reason they're allied with us not because they have some affinity towards us
15:32
so strategically speaking like the movement orders uh speaking what are you
15:39
most afraid of happening Russia and Austria allying because in
15:44
that case we there's nothing we can do I mean strategically as in your
15:50
movements like what is the worst thing that Russia can do to move against you on its own uh Romania into Bulgaria with
15:58
support from Serbia or Greece pull up one sec
16:06
there's just one move that they can pull right now oh it's it's what we were talking about Kenan um
16:13
if cuz there's a way we can protect um remember where it was hold on let me
16:19
find the map bulgaria potentially
16:25
because yeah your position is a little bit like uh how do how do you say it
16:30
it's like it's like a little not a little fried it's just like it's open like there's a couple of blind spots
16:36
bulgaria is open to the Black Sea and Romania has more Russian armies covering
16:42
it than you have armies defending it so
16:47
we can stop the attack on Romania but that might come at the price of
16:53
Bulgaria is the fear at the moment um we have enough to stop them from
17:00
getting Romania we calculated that a couple or yesterday no not yesterday
17:07
Friday um and we found a way to block that off that would just come at the
17:13
price of Bulgaria um the issue right now is we are assuming that they're going to
17:19
take Black Sea to attack Romania but if they don't do that and we go on long the assumption that they're
17:25
going to attack Bulgaria with Black Sea then the challenge that arises is we can
17:30
try to bounce them by using Greece but then if they do end up going
17:37
for Romania that means Austria gets Greece and then we still lose or sorry Austria gets Bulgaria in meaning that in
17:45
either of those circumstances there's a happy chance that we lose at least one of those territories so here's a funny
17:52
scenario do you think if do you think Austria masterminded that whole thing out like oh I am putting myself in a
18:00
position to win no matter what Russia does in the guise of defending Turkey at the same time
18:08
i don't think so because we're the ones who offered them Greece cuz we wanted Serbia and Bulgaria
18:14
i mean the initial thought process was we get that and then Greece is kind of secluded so we have an opportunity to expand into that area too mhm but there
18:22
was a confusion with the rules with both Austria and us um so we weren't able to
18:28
get Serbia that first cycle you mean Romania right no I mean Oh you weren't
18:34
able to get Serbia okay all right yeah austria ended up getting it but it was supposed to be that they get Serbia in
18:40
the spring cycle and then or no in the fall cycle and then once we were actually finishing it off when we're
18:47
actually going to get the bases they would move down into Greece and we would go into um
18:53
Serbia but that didn't end up working and so
18:59
we are now in a bit of a weird position like you pointed
19:06
out so moving forward what do each of you
19:11
think is the most important thing for you to do
19:18
get into more land areas and stop being landlocked
19:24
yeah and getting a fleet into the Aian so we can take Greece i think Greece is that that
19:32
soon that's actually kind of really fast you you're moving on Greece already
19:38
i don't think there's a viable path for us to expand without having Greece
19:45
ooh ooh how do you think Russia How do you think Austria is going to feel about that
19:52
i mean I'm not saying we take Greece immediately but I think the pressure from the Asian is going to be necessary sooner rather than later well if you if
20:01
you think that the attack on Austria is going to be soon then why aren't you allying with Russia for now cuz you
20:08
could have much more help taking out Austria right now instead of waiting for them to become a stronger threat later
20:15
because we just betrayed to take out Russia first well we just betrayed Russia so then Russia wouldn't ally with
20:22
us separately we can't exactly trust them to do that so do you think it's it's harder for people to forgive do you
20:28
think it's impossible for people to forgive stabbings in all honesty Russia's already
20:34
approached us to ally i just think I don't think I personally can trust Russia because we have just betrayed
20:40
them and so there's no way that they have our interest in mind so they're trying to fight for themselves which
20:46
makes sense but that doesn't make for the best ally
20:51
well do you think that saving them in a way by no longer attacking them could
20:57
leave them indebted to you could you hold that over them as something that
21:02
like a reason why they can't attack you no no because I think that already been
21:09
broken okay but all right it's an I I think
21:16
this is a very fascinating thing because like it it because it appears that you
21:21
have like blocked off all possibility of working with Russia again is there any way
21:26
that you you would see yourself working with them again i think it's feasible for it depends on
21:33
what we do this this turn probably if we ally with Russia or Austria
21:39
yeah cuz I mean they have offered like I mentioned and it's it's a fairly good offer um it would keep us a lot
21:46
safer but I think it is just asking for our inevitable demise like it'll keep us
21:51
alive for a couple of rounds and make us gain a couple like a couple extra territories in these next couple rounds
21:58
but the moment that happens I would not be surprised if they go against us do you think and also Italy would attack us
22:05
afterwards since we broke the treaty do you think that do you think if you
22:10
were to side with Russia that Italy or Russia would be able to stop
22:16
you because they have their own concerns italy has concerns with France and Russia is being attacked by both Germany
22:23
and England at the moment well that's mostly in the north their southern troops are unbothered at best
22:33
but an attack Okay all right like they have three troops down in Sav Ukraine and Gal so like they and in the Black
22:40
Sea none of those have the proximity the one in Gal and Ukraine maybe can move up
22:45
but seven Black Sea at the least are completely free at the moment but that would lead you to a larger presence down
22:52
in the Balkans and you would be theoretically able to ward off any
22:58
future plans of invasion against you from Russia not if we're split between both uh trying to fight off Austria and
23:06
going against Russia because like Austria isn't going
23:12
to be quick to take out their power is very consolidated in that region um if Russia moves in from the north um into
23:20
like Budapest and Vienna they would gain those territories if we go in from the east we could take Serbia and maybe
23:26
Greece italy wouldn't help um so Triass would be either Russia or us taking down
23:33
the turn after that um which means that Russia would gain
23:38
powers to an equal amount that we would which means the pressure that they're trying to apply is still going to be the same
23:45
so I want to return to the whole idea of stabbing your allies like if you were to
23:52
stab somebody else do you think that you
23:57
would be willing to make amends and rebuild that bridge let's say you stabbed Austria do you think they'd be
24:03
willing to work with you in the future again no i would actually think Russia is more
24:09
likely to work with us again than Austria cuz the whole bond with Austria is right now looking like we are trying to watch out for each other with Russia
24:15
it's very clear that everyone is just looking out for themselves but like working with Russia's helping out so they're doing it um so Russia it's more
24:23
of a business tie right those are easier to remake cuz the business can still come in again but with Austria it's
24:30
closer to a friendship and those ties are harder to rebuild so in the end
24:36
would you say that the whole situation where it's Austria Turkey and Russia
24:41
trying to see who will work with who to take out the other has been unresolved cuz you guys still seem to be on the
24:47
fence a little bit whether or not you want to stick with Austria or go with Russia
24:52
we would I personally at least would want to stick with Austria but like I don't think it's feasible to like ward
24:59
off Russia with our current position even if we were supported by Austria
25:04
since we'd either lose Romania or Bulgaria
25:10
what are your thoughts Bogia i think I would also like to stick with
25:15
Austria and I I wouldn't necessarily say it's not possible to ward them off i just think it would be playing a longer
25:21
game which I don't know if we have the troops for at the moment
25:30
do you think it's better to become larger faster or do you want to play the
25:36
slow game like perhaps not even growing one year and just sitting still and
25:41
sitting tight larger faster because then even if other
25:47
people ally against you there's still going to be a lot of people that want to ally with you in the first place
25:53
do you currently think that you are living up to that expectation duva no
26:00
do you not exactly i think our position is a little rough and it's been hard to like expand especially after the first
26:06
round do you have any desire to perhaps like sort of fulfill that end to like
26:14
stop being a slow paced like unnoticed country and going fast and hard
26:22
um I think I think that it's an option but not right now i think that that's something that we'd focus on later since
26:28
first you want people to fight against each other and eliminate them before you can like grow at like that speed
26:37
um I would ask Bogia to expand but for some reason he's not here i don't know why i want to come here not Not you
26:43
Ernest i said Bogia um but while you're here Ernest do you have any questions
26:49
for our friends here um the law doesn't pass
26:55
i didn't really want to ask any questions about allowed here about this thing all right that's that's valid
27:05
so we kind of talked about your thoughts on Russia Austria and
27:10
Italy and I'm actually kind of curious this will probably be one of our last questions about your thoughts on the
27:16
other three powers you mentioned France being one that had six centers and thus
27:21
was dangerous and you mentioned that Germany could be dangerous and England could be dangerous but what are your
27:27
overall thoughts on all three of them i think Germany about them or what the
27:34
allies are do you think that's a flaw do you think
27:39
that you should know more about that whole structure probably yeah but also I feel like it
27:45
doesn't make too much of a difference right now just because we're like not even accessible to each other i think that once we get into like a position
27:52
where we're like more playing with them that's when you build those allyships
27:57
though I will say Germany seems like a good prospect for an alliance at the moment especially for trying to target
28:02
Russia because I know they're also interested and they have been since the start we talked to them early on a
28:07
little bit with Germany trying to partner against Russia um we didn't have the force to complete the plan yet but
28:14
the closer and closer we get to trying to work against Russia I think Germanyy's going to be a good prospect for an ally yeah I probably need to get
28:23
going oh that's fine that's fine i I asked a lot of questions and I think this is the interview where I asked the
28:29
most thank you so much for your taking the time to ask I mean to answer all these questions and if you have any
28:35
questions for us feel free to ask them cuz like uh Jessica and Amber did that
28:40
and I was like what it's crazy you know who you think right now is playing the
28:46
smartest game well I do not feel like I should say
28:53
that because then it would just this just like an impartial game masterful
28:59
thing um so I that that's that's the type of question I can't answer i'm sorry i'm
29:05
not gonna I'm not even going to humor you there i can't do that unfortunate
29:12
so yeah i don't have too many questions but I want to say thank you to both of you for like you know being the game
29:18
masters and running this i think I've enjoyed it so far you're Thank you so much i'm personally just glad that you
29:24
are enjoying it so thank you for even giving this a shot that's That's what you should be you should be um you're
29:32
welcoming me you should be like
29:37
"So if you need to go you got to go." And I really enjoyed this i hope that we
29:43
can make this a weekend weekly thing if that's cool with you sure and orders are due by the end of
29:52
class on Monday so you better get on that sounds good sounds good thank you
29:57
so much bye
