0:01
dog 111 yep don't make fun of it please
0:07
what do you mean don't make fun of it it's you choose to have that name you can Okay I think I can join so
0:15
I will be back okay why would Why did Nathan have to leave again he wanted to join on his computer
0:22
why did you
0:29
come on spit it out mac I'm trying to phrase it right
0:34
you know people sometimes put like one after the name to like so people know their first place but you really didn't want them to forget so you had to play
0:41
three times right or or wait wait Matt back the more simple explanation is he
0:49
doesn't want people to forget that he's 111th place
0:55
so Razer we do have a lot to get through guys because we missed last week so this
1:02
week it might be a little bit little bit informationheavy especially because we have to cover a lot more so I guess we
1:09
should go straight into it like and to be honest I mean like I feel like this
1:15
is quite simple although you decided not to move Western Mediterranean into Spain
1:21
was there a reason for that or I mean this was a long time ago so I don't blame you if you do not remember but
1:26
like well do you do you remember if I'm not mistaken it was because we
1:33
didn't want them we were moving two into Lio which would leave Tunisia undefended
1:40
and allow them to take a center away from us which we thought would not be
1:45
optimal i see i I mean like what I see is on a fall
1:51
turn generally it's it's like conventional to take
1:56
centers I guess but I think that um
2:03
the I think the the sorry hold
2:08
on I think France's decision to like hold three units is definitely interesting here but yeah I do think
2:15
that there's not really much to infer from your move set cuz it's pretty just
2:21
going going against France is that correct yeah pretty much this was also the turn
2:28
that sort of marked the fall of Germany which you guys were at some point
2:34
working closely with how did you feel about that
2:39
um I don't I don't Go ahead Nathan i don't have much to say me either like we
2:46
were we were had an alliance with them potentially if they had wanted to
2:51
partner with us in the future but they were too concerned with England and Russia and so it wasn't like an
2:58
immediate care obviously it wasn't like awesome because then England and France started gaining more centers and same
3:04
with Russia but um Austria we didn't mind as much
3:09
because they're our allies it seemed like it was a very like turnbyturn
3:14
alliance rather been like a long-term alliance like it could have shifted at any time and so yeah we didn't really
3:21
care as much I think yeah all right well I guess we should
3:28
move on to the next phase and you ch you do not have any builds here
3:35
but like do you have any meaningful commentary on France's choice to destroy
3:42
Pikerty here they're stupid don't put that
3:49
damn i mean obviously I can say anything now that I'm worth future in the game i
3:57
wouldn't have had commentary then now my commentary would be going to be leaving a lot undefended for England but that's
4:04
a choice they can make i mean yeah the I mean I my
4:09
interpretation is that this is a this is a clear declaration of hey I'm not going
4:14
to focus anything on England i'm going to focus everything I have on Italy
4:20
and obviously that's not good and we'll get to the we'll get to the
4:25
lore later but yeah there I mean like at a certain point I'm guessing this attack
4:31
did not become very profitable that that you did that you did not want to
4:36
continue the attack you genuinely didn't but the time to do that had passed I assume anyways moving on to the next one
4:43
great move i have to admit I love this move so much um what what made you uh
4:49
really uh think about it that way what made you come up with it is what I'm trying to
4:55
say i'm sorry Nathan i don't remember how we came up with this i don't or me i
5:01
feel I think it was me but I think the the the thinking behind it was we wanted
5:07
something that was like we wanted an army foothold on that side of the
5:13
continent rather than it being just like completely fleets and so yeah that was
5:19
really it not much more to it and then we see the people moving to Venice and try moving
5:26
to Venice as a Yeah yeah i would actually like I would actually like to
5:32
have you explain what that was what What exactly was that that was a planned bounce in order to make it look like we
5:39
were fighting with Austria and convince other people to work with us in
5:46
other ways mhm um it was originally to convince France that we were going to move back into
5:51
Austria which did not exactly work out when we kept attacking France um but
5:59
that was the initial intention like hey let's make it look like we have some beef so we have leverage with other
6:04
people do you think this uh this move achieved that goal or I don't know i
6:10
don't think people noticed it very much i think everyone has was so concerned with Germany at the time that it didn't really have a great effect
6:17
it wasn't as significant as it it could have been potentially i
6:22
see okay now on to I know you guys hate me for this one because this is this is
6:28
where you turned in your orders two seconds late and I went for Nathan's verbal orders i am very sorry about that
6:36
guys um I have no comment on this no comment well your original orders what
6:43
exactly were they again so I think the mixup was my or what I
6:50
wanted to do would have worked and what McKenna wanted to do would have worked but because because of the chaos it was
6:58
a amalgamation of our orders like half and half or something like that so it
7:04
just didn't work out i believe I actually might be able to find Let me see if I can because I had texted Nathan
7:11
two different orders oh hello okay let me see wait can you
7:18
search what year was it it was uh fall 1903
7:29
let's see i don't know if this is a time waste but I think
7:38
I Spain i don't know when this was i can't find my text and I don't remember
7:43
my old i think I found it was it the ETH uh yeah it was Army Spain move to Mar
7:50
fleet lyo support army Spain move to Mar army Pedmont support army Spain move to Mar um army west move into Spain or if
7:58
Gaskin goes to Spain Army Pedmont move to Mar oh wait this was later wasn't it
8:05
no what you're saying what you're what you're saying makes sense then and honestly like well and this this move
8:12
that we that ended up getting sent in would have worked if if Spain had just supported Padmont which is the really
8:19
upsetting part well they would have been two centers and quite beneficial
8:26
do you think that um how do I say this do you think the game would be different now yes
8:34
i'm very sorry guys it's okay cuz like I I wanted to impose stricter rules
8:40
because Austria and Turkey were kind of like you know bending it they were they
8:45
were saying "Oh no five more minutes after I said "Hey I want you to turn it in here." So I'm really sorry that you
8:52
guys ended up getting caught in the crossfire and speaking of Austria uh do you have any meaningful commentary on
8:59
why they held all units here no uh wait
9:04
was that an accident or was that on purpose i can't I think he Gabriel claimed publicly to everybody that it
9:10
was on purpose i think he told us that it was an accident cuz we we've been close allies
9:16
and so like they've been honest when they've made mistakes even when they haven't said it publicly and we don't mind it happens
9:24
it does happen indeed so at this point you and France have the
9:31
same center count and you decide to go build an army uh do you think that was
9:36
the correct move and why do you think that you built that army
9:41
uh at this point in the game do I think it was the right move i think go ahead
9:48
i don't remember really but I think our reasoning was we still didn't fully trust Austria so we just wanted
9:54
something there just in case because they do they did have two centers right next to Venice so
10:01
at this point in the game I do not think that that was the optimal move mhm considering how strong our alliance with
10:07
Austria has been that was we could have we could have done something different but at the time
10:12
I totally agree it was because we weren't 100% sure on Austria's loyalty that is an
10:18
interesting conclusion there because I thought you and Austria were tight from the very start what made you question
10:24
their loyalty we were but they had two next to us they had Trius and Tyr and it
10:31
it was still early and so we we weren't sure if they're just playing it till this point but I I do genuinely believe
10:38
they're like a good they're good people and they're not they're not like trying to backstab us good people
10:45
i don't believe Sean is a good person personally I'm just kidding i Well was it So correct me if I'm wrong but like
10:55
was it around here that you guys were like starting to talk about peace with France at all no no not this one you
11:04
guys Mhm i mean unfortunate B unfortunate series of movements here
11:09
because this this is a just it it perfectly counters your attack here i
11:16
think breast moving to MAO was the weakest part of this because that gave them more support than we had mhm yeah
11:25
i also and also Belle moving to Burgundy i wonder who thought of this way to
11:32
counter them it's very unfortunate you wonder don't Don't point me at in that don't point at me okay
11:40
i'm just messing with you i know you would have told anyone and I think that's good i think that it's good that you're helping all teams i just
11:47
wish in my evil little heart that they hadn't known that that would work yeah
11:53
you know what you know what else upsets me i'm trying to tell everybody i was like "Yo guys I want to give a
11:58
presentation on advanced diplomacy moves." And everybody was like "Yeah that's a good idea." But the people who
12:04
know the most Oddvey and also Austria for some reason are like "No no no don't
12:09
tell anybody else strategies i I I I think my strategy is perfectly fine you know but hey it's it's okay." And I also
12:19
want to touch up on that whole strategy aspect too because the more that I have
12:24
played diplomacy the more I've realized that the strate strategic part of it
12:29
comes down to like basically a glorified game of rock paper scissors where you
12:35
have optimal options and they have optimal options so unless you're really really good at
12:41
guessing what the other team is going to do then you cannot solely rely on the
12:47
strategic part of that and when it comes to a situation like this where you have
12:53
five units and they have five units it's like a coin toss yeah well that's how we
12:58
felt most times making these decisions that's why we got our orders in late that one time is because we weren't sure
13:05
if they were going to try to move Gasghi in or use Gas Giddy to support and we thought we could get around it either
13:11
way but alas all right let's see is there anything
13:17
else happening here not really although I assume you were talking to England
13:23
throughout this entire like this entire like whole scenario about attacking
13:29
France uh how do you think that went i mean why do you think they haven't attacked
13:37
i couldn't tell you they say it's because they're fighting Austria or sorry Russia
13:43
but I think they just don't want to support us slash want
13:50
France alive i'm not really sure what they want to be honest to be very frank
13:55
I think that their loyalties make very little sense and I I
14:01
don't understand what they want well maybe you have thoughts i think that it's potentially if they are focused if
14:10
France is focused on us it leaves that region open and they can swoop in at any time but maybe like creating an alliance
14:19
so that like they don't focus on them and can keep this like one border at bay
14:24
but then they can also swoop in at any time so it's like you have security but you also have available resources if
14:30
needed i don't know all right
14:35
um so let's move on to the next phase here where unfortunately they just
14:42
overpower Spain and you managed to get into Marseilles you mentioned just like
14:49
a minute ago five minutes ago that this was where you started kind of negotiating for peace what motivated
14:56
that uh move on your part i can't tell if it was this one or the next one but I
15:01
don't remember i think it wasn't really peace i I mean every people wanted us to
15:09
do it and also France was like kind of wanting us to do it but we we didn't really ever want to
15:17
stop attacking them i don't know i feel like it was Plus we didn't really ever trust them because you know was it this
15:25
move where they said they'd hold and they didn't Nathan i don't think so i don't think so okay there was It might
15:30
be the next one yeah well I they they make up they Yeah i don't
15:38
know i mean I actually I'm very curious as to why you don't tr you mean like did you not trust France even before they
15:45
lied to you no the initial reason we went after France was like because I think France has such a tactical
15:51
advantage by just getting Spain and Mar or and and um Portugal right bat
15:57
immediately getting six centers um and so I thought Spain or French
16:03
France was a threat from the beginning and I was trying to tell people that and then they did grow powerful but then it
16:08
kind of has waned as England and other places have taken over more um but that
16:14
was the initial reason we went after them so hard and then now it's because I Sean and Elena are very finicky and
16:21
finicky yeah i don't know they say like oh maybe this maybe that that there's it's hard to like and I'm sure a lot of
16:28
it is because I'm also stubborn and me and Ethan have been very like we're not
16:34
going to do like we don't want to give them things so I don't know it's been hard to work with them yeah when it yeah
16:42
okay that you touch up on a very interesting subject your stubbornness cuz you know this is I mean I guess
16:49
we're I'm going to add some context here because this stubbornness of yours is not unique to this game alone
16:56
phone i've played with this person and this is a pattern i'm telling you
17:02
i'm quite stubborn and I know that and I Are you referring to the game where I
17:09
refused to work with you the whole game yeah no no no i was Russia you were Germany i think you were on call because
17:14
you couldn't make it there and like I was I I was so frustrated because you
17:22
had I feel like I mean in my perspective that you had no better choice because England and France were attacking you
17:29
and Austria and Turkey were attacking me they were going to get most of my centers and they were going to overpower you and I kept saying that narrative but
17:36
you wouldn't listen you stuck to your guns and while I while I admired that
17:41
like stubbornness can be very self harming yeah unhelpful at times i know
17:48
and I'm trying this this right now cuz we're in such a bad position dang it it's hard to focus on
17:55
the things of the past but it our analysis of our current
18:00
situation i'm stuck between I don't know if it's really just my stubbornness anymore against France or like staying
18:07
alive like I know it appears stubborn but I can't tell if like attacking them is the right strategy to literally just
18:13
maintain aliveness or if it genu genuinely would
18:18
be good to just hold cuz everything seems risky and so I don't know nathan
18:24
do you have thoughts on my stubbornness i think it's funny that Sean and Elena
18:30
have res resorted to talking to me rather than you and trying to avoid you
18:38
like they they'll purposely talk to me while you're away negotiating with other
18:43
people and then the moment you come back you start like shoeing them away
18:52
i can stop it's okay i just at this point they've they've kind of not
18:57
listened to us twice and they were trying to argue that the latest deal we gave them was super unfair but it really
19:03
wasn't because they were right next to two of our centers and we I don't know we were not
19:11
next to two well actually we were next to two but they didn't even they didn't even ask us to move out anyways we can
19:16
get into the details of that deal later but here there's another interesting part of the board that I would actually
19:22
like to dress and it would be the fact that Austria has been growing at a much faster rate than you guys did this worry
19:30
you at all or were you confident that those forces would be spent in other places
19:37
uh it was slightly concerning but I overall had confidence and was fine with
19:42
them as long as like cuz I think I thought they were still loyal to us at this time
19:48
me too but my concern was growing like oh no what if they recognize us as like a weak power and just try to take it all
19:56
is it is the dilemma mhm all right moving on to the next phase this was the
20:02
one where you asked for peace and they did not deliver no no
20:08
yes they told us they would not what was it Nathan i don't remember they asked us to hold yeah and we held
20:17
and they did not listen which is really really frustrating and then we tried doing something the next round and they
20:23
still didn't listen well
20:29
unfortunately the capacity to forgive is often lost in games like
20:35
these and well it I've I've been in that position
20:42
too it's very frustrating when you when your interests don't align
20:50
and you know I mean correct me if I'm wrong but do you interpret it as oh if
20:55
we stopped earlier then we could have all avoided this like if when they were asking for peace if we had listened
21:02
would we not be struggling now is that like a thought that's okay i think
21:07
regardless because of our like our like deal with Austria we would be in the
21:14
exact same place because we can't expand east well we could but yeah
21:24
but I do think Go ahead go ahead no I think that we were very aggressive and
21:31
stubborn and we did say some fighting words so that
21:37
probably contributed that one wasn't just me we both Yeah that was that was me too but I was just
21:43
being funny and I I I didn't know what was going on in the game partially so I was just ensuing chaos i was like Nathan
21:51
don't say that to them all right so but yes this definitely has soiled our
21:57
relationship with France even more and I'm a forgiving person in real
22:04
life but I'm also a very it's you break the
22:09
trust man you know what I mean and then they did it again so it's going to be very hard to work with them in the future would you think you're a type of
22:15
person or player to hold grudges yes yeah m I think yes because I think I
22:24
mean I think you have to be careful and take risks but I I see like working with anyone unless they've proven themselves
22:29
in the past as like kind of a risk so and sometimes it's worth taking those like all the stuff that B or Russia and
22:37
Austria and England and France have been doing is always like risking trusting each other because they could always
22:44
support the other side i don't I don't think we've had as much of those situations because we're so one-on-one
22:49
with France this is so regional um but trusting France has been a kind of a
22:54
risk both times and they've proven us wrong both times so is it holding a grudge or is it learning from the past mistakes do you think that when it comes
23:02
down to it that you would be able to set us that that a peace agreement could be
23:08
made for the greater good if somebody like Russia or England or Austria was
23:14
running away with the game let's say they had 17 centers do you think peace could be made then with us and France
23:20
yes if it was ex as extreme as 17 centers then yes otherwise it was like
23:27
two of us against one huge nation then I'd be willing to work but if it was it
23:33
was anything else I would rather the other nation win yeah because I mean that was the You've
23:41
got to go to the current slide dude ah we'll make our way there how about we move on then to this one this one
23:49
austria Russia and England oh no russia Russia Austria and France were all like
23:55
"Oh yeah just just hold your troops like just hold your like I France is willing to compromise hold your troops." And we
24:02
were like "Okay." And then guess what france did not follow through and now
24:07
we're in a risky situation so this is I I totally agree with Nathan if it was
24:13
extreme then maybe but France has kind of proven that even when other nations
24:19
want them to do something and when they say they might do something then they're unlikely to follow through this was also
24:26
a very important turn um where England Austria and Russia the the three big
24:34
players with eight centers each decided to duke it out in the middle of the board do you have any thoughts on that
24:43
i think Austria was very trusting of everything that was going on but
24:49
Russia Adve actually not Russia well the Byzantine Empire now I guess but Russia
24:56
and Samir in the background yeah the the puppet is like they're very they play
25:02
both sides very well and it like while we were in the classroom it did seem like Adve was like oh like was really
25:09
much on our side but like like looking back obviously there's like hindsight
25:14
bias but like it it is very interesting how he plays both sides and he's just you know interesting guy interesting
25:21
player do you so all right this is a different question than who do you think is most likely to win but out of like
25:30
the players here who do you think is most deserving of the win right now okay deserving or who do we want to win
25:37
deserving not want like like have who has played the
25:44
best game and thus deserves the win i think I think I think Jessica and Amber
25:51
I would say are pretty deserving to win i would say that they've they've not
25:58
made very long-term alliances and used that as kind of an excuse to do whatever they want and it has worked so that's
26:05
been a good strategy now I'm guessing you want Austria to win or yourself yeah it'd be us and then
26:13
Austria and then and then if neither of those win honestly I might just support Obey um I
26:20
would support England actually no i would kind of I don't know i am tied between the two of
26:27
England or England told us that they were going to have I I cut
26:34
mao which wouldn't have done anything but wait was it this round or the next
26:42
round there was one round where it would have changed something and it was frustrating that they did not follow through with that i think I would want a
26:48
to win out of England and Russia because I think it just would be really funny yeah see I I agree actually Seline would
26:58
be so mad seline would be so mad
27:03
seline would be mad if Amber won yeah Gabe and Seline would be even more mad if England won I think i think they're
27:09
number one ops yeah so that's actually I really I have an interview with them after this i'm really interested in why
27:16
they got so mad at England for Russia taking their Munich center i think
27:22
that's so funny they got more mad at the person that helped the guy destroy them than the guy
27:29
that was destroying them i feel like they trusted them more and it was more of a heartbreak but I was right yeah i
27:37
thought they when they told us our plans they said they they planned they were like playing both sides and they wanted
27:43
to they were like supposedly working with both sides but they were secretly pursuing their own agenda so when they
27:50
actually did pursue their own agenda and both of them didn't like really help like both England and Russia didn't
27:56
really aid in that they got upset it is my I don't really know it is my interpretation that England and Russia
28:03
saw through Gabe and Seline's nonsense like oh they're playing us we got to work together but that's very possible
28:11
but hey we can move on to the next round actually that' probably be better where
28:18
unfortunately it it looked it's not looking good for you and uh Austria destroys their fleet in
28:25
Greece here i mean I don't Do you have any like anything meaningful to say about that because that kind of pertains
28:30
to you their fleet power is now you know not as great and thus it leaves you with
28:36
more power in the Mediterranean over them I suppose yes
28:42
i still wouldn't want to betray them at this point yes and I think that even if we had I
28:48
think we need all the support we can get on the western side of Italy and if we
28:53
Go ahead if it comes down to it like France is going to kill you
29:00
like would you be willing to throw away that Austrian alliance just to survive
29:05
more for longer i don't know actually what do you think Nathan
29:11
i was thinking I would rather us give our territory to Austria yeah I kind of
29:16
feel that way too i mean in what scenario do you think feeding would be a
29:23
strategic advantage because like whenever you feed it obviously changes the dynamic of the game because you're
29:29
throwing essentially but when do you think it would actually be of strategic importance to us or to Austria to to you
29:37
we don't we just I think Nathan Yeah I think I think that I know that
29:44
like winning the game is like the point of the game but at this point I do feel this
29:51
this sense of care for Austria and like if they won it would feel like part
29:58
partially ours too and cuz you know we part of the reason
30:03
they were able to go so ham on other places is because we have had our alliance and it hasn't really worked out
30:09
for us but if it worked out for them I think that's a good thing to be is to be happy for others but would we like to
30:15
not die yeah that'd be pretty nice all right well I have a very I have a
30:25
very sort of like negative view on throwing giving centers to your friends
30:33
because there I mean I know it's silly to say this but like if you're on one
30:39
center there is that chance that you're able to come back and I'd much rather be
30:44
the legendary hero that came back from one center or even did well after getting to one center than the guy who
30:52
gave up and gave his centers to his friends oh oh don't mistake us we're not throwing the game yet um yet
31:00
we're I think we're still hoping to that things will work out in our favor especially with England going so strong
31:08
it's possible they will suck energy away from France um but yeah it's I I still think we I
31:18
have hope for coming back and we're just like one of those flowers that like closes at night when it gets cold and
31:23
then like opens in the day um but
31:29
this let's just say it's a cold cold night let's just say that
31:35
so so here I think if I correct me if I'm wrong but this was another phase
31:40
where a deal was broken yes they told us that they were going to hold and I Okay in
31:49
fairness they said they'd willing to make a deal with us and then waited the entire period until the last 10 minutes
31:54
of walking over to McBride to suggest it or confront us i said "We'll agree to it
32:00
as long as you move one of your fleets out which is a perfectly reasonable thing to do." Okay and so they said
32:08
"Okay we'll move NAF to MAO." And I said "Great then we'll hold everything else."
32:14
And they they had this weird perception in their minds that was like "But we
32:19
don't know if you're going to move Pys into West we don't move if we don't know if you'll move you know P like we don't
32:26
know what you'll and I was like that's the point of the game is you don't know what the other person is going to do or
32:31
if they're going to uphold their part of the bargain that's why it's called diplomacy but I didn't yell like that
32:37
but that's what was going on my head and I was like yes we have to mutually trust
32:42
that's why it's hard and and they were like but we don't want to move a fleet out and I was like yes that's why it's
32:48
called the compromise um and then I I did I will admit that
32:54
this was not like the kindest move but I said at the last minute maybe like 10 20
33:00
30 seconds I said "Oh you're so you're keeping Ly you're holding LIO then we're
33:06
going to move Tus to Lyo and if you uphold your deal it's going to bounce sounds good." And they were too frantic
33:12
and so they didn't really respond but I was like "Well if you hold if they upheld their end of the bargain then
33:18
they keep all of the territory they said they would." And then we just bounced so it was it was just like a
33:23
test and then they seem to get really mad over that but they betrayed us so I don't know why they were so pissy
33:29
because I told them exactly what we were going to do and exactly you know what I mean mhm so they act like it was an
33:35
extremely unfair bargain they then take back Marseilles
33:40
don't listen to either of what they said not only do they move in back into Marseilles but they don't even move NAF
33:46
to MA and we help so I definitely don't want to listen to anyone h
33:53
personally I think Go ahead Nathan i was watching the new kids of Weeull coming
34:00
into the classroom so I didn't I wasn't here for this chaos
34:07
it was bad i like was I was like right next to them i was like "All right then I'm going to move my 2D into bounce
34:13
don't worry about it it's just gonna bounce okay they're gonna hold right?" And they were like "What you're gonna move and I was like just just
34:22
it's I promise if you hold and then they were like okay and then they moved and then guess what we got an O because
34:28
otherwise you'd be freaking dead you got I I would describe France and
34:34
Italy's relationship as like a dysfunctional marriage and you need like you need like couples counseling cuz you
34:41
can't communicate with each other i am being honest with them i was honest
34:46
with them what we were doing maybe a heartto-he heart is what you need a heart to heart like a movie
34:53
moment you know what i will admit my stubbornness is a downfall in some
34:58
situations where people are very uncompromising and I am scared because I
35:03
don't think they're willing to compromise or acknowledge the other side so I think this is a better situation to
35:09
just let go and never talk about it again well there are more pressing manners
35:15
than your squabble with France i would have I would say at the very least
35:24
and yeah this what yeah what was I'm assuming
35:29
nothing nothing fancy happened here you were just like just taking out all your
35:34
anger on France you could describe us as a single mom who works two jobs who
35:40
loves her kids and never stops okay Dolly Parton i think we are more
35:49
like divorced parents fighting for custody of the child that is l yo and
35:55
that area and we are pursuing legal means and battling it out in the courts
36:01
yep oh it's such a it's such a stressful situation here but actually wait there's
36:07
one thing I do want to get your thoughts on austria and Russia their relationship
36:13
here doesn't look too great it's kind of rocky right but they seem to have made
36:19
up in the next phase which I think is so funny like their their ability to
36:25
forgive each other and work towards what they see as a common goal is something
36:32
that I believe that the Italian and French players sort of lack what do you
36:39
think is different about them that allows them to do this and what can you maybe learn from it so that you can
36:45
apply it to France i don't know because I think Austria and
36:51
Russia are both in different circumstances where they can expand elsewhere while not encroaching on each
36:56
other's territory we are only fighting one side and we can't really move anywhere else and if they were to divert
37:03
their resources to fight the British and for us to hold we're just doing nothing at all
37:09
and we're not gaining anything and yeah they're just stagnant unless Unless of
37:14
course you stab Austria but I'm pretty sure that's not an option not right now
37:20
i don't want to stab Austria okay not yet Kenan i know but this is
37:28
why it took me so long to work with you in that game what do you What huh what
37:33
wait how i don't got to say I think I think that I think
37:39
that I was going to say something i I failed to see the connection how
37:45
like I I was like unless you stabbed Austrian like this is why I can't work this is why it took so long for me to
37:51
work with you i don't I fail to see the connection what
38:00
um it's because you're so willing to Well I play in a way that's best for me
38:07
and if you can convince me that something is better for me then hell yeah and also I'm I'm the type of guy
38:14
that would like see an inequality in an alliance and work to resolve that
38:20
inequality through like not maybe not even a direct stab but just like maybe
38:26
assisting the enemy to check the my allies power because like if it becomes an imbalance like that you just you're
38:32
just worse off you're not getting as much out of the alliance than you should have blah blah blah but we were think
38:38
we've been thinking about that and talking about it but at this point it's looking rough i don't know
38:48
like let's see this is the current state of the game spring
38:54
1907 you guys the Italian players have clearly
38:59
had an extremely rough time and no shade
39:06
in order if you do desire any sort of win in this game I
39:12
think it's a safe bet to say that you need to switch up your strategy whatever
39:17
you're doing right now has well historically not been working so what do
39:22
you Historically it would have worked but that's not okay okay do you understand what you're saying
39:30
historically it would have worked even though historically it didn't move they wanted if everyone did the moves they
39:36
wanted everything would have been fine what do you think that you guys need to do differently if you are going to
39:42
reverse your situation i'll let you take this one then I don't
39:49
know because I think that if we were to betray Austria that we would need to
39:57
sacrifice resources unless unless unless they are unless France is so preoccupied
40:03
with England that it doesn't care at all about us and leaves us alone then I
40:08
think that if we were to divert resources to betray Austria our home centers would be at major risk and
40:16
considering that even if we were willing to work with France I don't think France
40:24
in any way will believe us and so that I don't think that they would let us leave without going in on
40:33
us we are more vulnerable right now so even if we thought it'd be nice to
40:39
take Austria centers it's quite frankly not possible because of
40:45
France's repetitive betrayals
40:51
all right so that's it there's no common ground there's nothing you can do i
40:57
think the main Go ahead if we wanted that Pedmont Pedmont is like quite vital
41:04
and I think if we wanted a pretty strong actually I don't know if this would work i haven't thought this
41:11
through and I just thought of it this would take a while and it would not really work actually no never mind you want to
41:17
say it you should say it no I don't it's not going to work and it's going to take too long any idea is an idea worth
41:24
sharing if you have the a fleet in the Adriatic Sea constantly supporting
41:30
Pedmont then they're not like prone to
41:35
Sorry the Adriatic Sea cannot support Piedmont you can only support
41:43
I see no no no yeah the the the the fleet in Venice can support Piedmont no
41:48
it cannot can it not oh it can't oh never mind it can't because Venice you can support
41:54
it to hold no you need to if there's a fleet in Venice you can't support across
42:00
land into Pedmont i see never mind
42:05
well okay i I'm sure I mean I have no idea if it would work but
42:14
I really hate it when people get into this sort of position and they have this nihilistic view because I the the best
42:24
thing to do in a hopeless situation is to not give up hope we haven't given up hope i'm glad but what do you expect us
42:32
to do act like Ove no no no see the victory is imminent okay this is just
42:37
temporary and what we're really planning is to switch it all up in the future and uh we'd really like to work together
42:43
with you i do believe it's it's Russia for the win in the end that's that's how I feel i do believe that there is a
42:48
genuine interest in like having in France turning around and facing England
42:55
totally agree it'd be nice if England participated in that well France was
43:01
willing to do that sorry the other the other thing I mean like there's there's tons of stuff you can use and I I guess
43:07
I'm just helping you out cuz I I don't I don't think that it's fair for you guys
43:14
to just go out now oh man you see this is I think this
43:20
this game has taught me I suck at game mastering cuz I I want I want I want everyone to win but I don't want anyone
43:26
to lose i mean Kina not everyone not every game master interviews players
43:34
it's okay the the thing the thing is you may say your advice or not the choice is
43:39
yours i'm I'm going to basically you could you can make you can make this
43:45
ultimatum with France right basically saying that he can choose to continue
43:50
attacking and if you do they're going to have trouble breaking through it'll take a while for them because you know the
43:58
fleets need to get around your fleets and they somehow need to get your army kicked out as well and past that you'll
44:04
be able to defend quite well for quite a while are they willing to go for that
44:10
prolonged war while everybody else especially Russia especially England
44:15
have the chance to grow larger and out compete both of you clearly there is an interest in making
44:24
peace and focusing on the larger enemies so that you guys can still retain the
44:31
chance to win because like France he could get more centers he could get Tunis he could get your home centers but
44:37
those are far away several moves and if he gets lucky he'll have it by a second year of fighting but will there even be
44:44
a second year of fighting will someone have won by then that's the question and I really hope that you convince them
44:50
because that would be so interesting and a shock to everyone when fleets go the opposite
44:57
direction but that's wishful thinking and it's hard to break a rocky track
45:04
record mhm you're making me think now
45:10
h
45:16
we'll see what happens i really really hope you guys manage to succeed cuz I
45:22
mean like karma karma dictates man you've done so you've experienced so many bad things you need to experience a
45:27
good thing every once in a while right we shall see we shall see so here's the
45:35
I think this is the last but very important question out of everybody on the board who do you think has the best
45:42
chance of winning right now right now probably Russia cuz I know England is the strongest but Russia can manipulate
45:48
pretty well england's the strongest england's England england well everyone's
45:55
everyone's afraid of England but I think Russia is the real threat i think they're very good at placing blame and
46:01
placing worry at other places is there anything that you What are you
46:06
going to do about that guys how are you going to How are you going to stop this Russian threat
46:13
if if we have an ultimatum with France we could support Austria in their
46:19
endeavors in formerly Turkey but I don't know we shall see that could
46:26
be imagine Imagine Italian Simna or Italian Constantinople maybe Italian an
46:33
anchor but hey
46:38
do you have any questions for us actually Ernest sorry ernest do you have any questions of your own because I feel like I've been taken a predominant I
