0:00
you've got places to be apparently So let's do this kind of fast I guess So
0:07
this was the phase that we left off with with Italy still attacking you and
0:13
everything else happening everywhere else This was Wait did we already talk
0:19
about the fall of Germany yeah we did Do So yeah you kind of you kind of
0:24
let that happen and you didn't really gain much out of Germany How do you feel about that
0:34
i don't think we like we kind of realized it like at this at this point
0:39
and we were just like "Oh." And I think that was when we kind of this
0:47
like this will relate to the round that just happened but like I think we were
0:53
like we're not really benefiting from these alliances as much as like England
0:58
Russia was kind of the vibe which continued Yeah At this point I think we
1:06
realized or we had to like shift everything over to Italy and then we
1:13
couldn't get our share of Germany because Austria also sneaked in there into Munich So that kind of sucked for
1:18
us Yeah Well I don't believe that this phase has much to offer in terms of like
1:25
analysis but we can just move on to the next one and see how we feel about that
1:31
here Uh Italy be builds a fleet in Naples and obviously that's that's not
1:40
that's that's a build that could be harmful towards you What are your thoughts on that
1:49
um I guess it was like kind of necessary to get them to disband in Spain Like we
1:54
forced a disband there in Spain H like it was easier to take Spain and give up
2:01
Marseilles for now and then take it back later but like the fleet um was kind of
2:08
harmful but like as we'll see later on like we kind of like took care of that and we pushed them out So I it like it
2:14
worked out Okay Okay Yeah Well said Here is the other interesting thing that
2:21
happened The English decided to build a fleet in Liverpool Um no What are your thoughts on that
2:31
oh yeah That was kind of scary And like we asked them like what's going on and they said they're like pretending to
2:38
cooperate with the Italians And I guess we didn't have like much of a choice to
2:43
stop that And I think we trusted them enough to not attack us
2:49
But it was still kind of like scary I guess Yeah It's
2:55
like we kind of h had no other choice other than to trust them in that moment
3:01
because like they have so much like leverage over us I feel like so I think that this phase is a very poetic phase
3:09
and I'm not saying that to be weird just that you and Italy have five centers
3:14
while everybody else on the board has eight Now correct me if I'm wrong but do you
3:21
think that this reflects how your relationship with Italy has affected your position in the game generally
3:27
compared to everybody else yeah it prevented us from like expanding
3:35
anywhere It like forced us into like cooperating with the English and there
3:42
wasn't much choice except for us to be like locked down there while everyone else expanded
3:48
Yeah that's definitely true Like we had to focus on like defending ourselves instead of like acquiring So yeah
3:56
I Yeah Okay This is interesting So I think that this next phase is
4:02
important for a couple of reasons because I think this is where you transition from being on the defense to
4:09
being on the offense where you have yourself uh forcing yourself into
4:15
Western Mediterranean and forcing Portugal into Spain And what what do you think
4:22
motivated this move exactly
4:28
this move I Oh yeah Sorry Go ahead Um I think we're just trying to get back into
4:33
like Mars and that was just like our game plan was to like get back Spain
4:39
initially and then like go east The Okay The It was I I would say this
4:46
is a very good positional play on your part just like getting the fleets around necessary to take back Marseilles The
4:53
other interesting thing to talk about here is Russia failing to provide orders
4:59
and throwing a class Um what are your thoughts on that
5:07
i think that was like that was like the stupidest mistake they could have made Yeah because now England has gotten to
5:15
St Petersburg And I mean the Russians got there anyways but they could have like
5:21
made pretty good moves to um threaten Austria but like you know I was really hoping a
5:30
could convince uh you but like it's like it's okay
5:37
Yeah it is It is very unfortunate The Well we could we could we could
5:43
touch back on the Russians again but at this point do you still view them as one
5:50
of your closer allies like do you want them to do well
5:57
h I mean I think that's like a difficult question just because our allies are so
6:06
like massive and so that kind of produces like uh like an issue because
6:13
on one hand it's like okay well we want you to do well and like stay in the game because you're helping us and like that
6:19
you being alive like benefits us but at the same time like you may get too big
6:24
to the point where this relationship it doesn't work anymore So I think like that's kind of the the handoff with
6:32
Russia Also another very important thing to talk about here correct me if I'm wrong but were
6:39
there peace negotiations happening with Italy at this time
6:44
there were What caused those to fail i think we initially
6:51
planned to not we were just kind of what Austria
6:57
came to us was hey you guys are going to
7:02
get attacked by England You need to move like your like your armies up to the
7:08
north and if you do this we are allies with Italy So we will force them agree
7:13
to agree to not do anything to you guys if you agree to like uh keep your hands
7:20
off of Marseilles and we talked like Sean and I talked
7:25
privately after that and we just like were like let's just do the negotiations
7:32
but like let's like not do them essentially So that was kind of the plan
7:37
initially There wasn't really like a failure in the negotiation stage Yeah Was there
7:44
I mean that came later actually There was a there was a piece there was a peace thing before that wasn't there oh
7:51
wait Am I like having amnesia what are we talking about for this turn the Italians and the
7:58
Austrians the Italians help the Austrians move into Burgundy I think peace talks started
8:05
after that but we don't quite remember this So
8:13
Yeah we dislodged their fleet and Leon though so we're like one step closer to
8:19
getting Marseilles back The I guess the I guess the interesting other thing
8:27
to talk about here is Russia attacking the Austrians here Uh do you have any
8:33
substantive commentary to provide on that front
8:42
um I thought that was like maybe not
8:47
smart on the Austrians part because they just held everything instead of support
8:53
holding anything But it was still a good move by Ove to
9:00
disband that army The other Wait I completely forgot This is this is what
9:06
I've completely forgot that fall 1905 was one of the most interesting years of this game because we have this whole
9:12
situation happening in Germany where Russia is getting support by you and
9:18
England against Austria Mhm What motivated this move why did you
9:23
decide to do that oh I remember this Okay Wait now I remember this this
9:29
season I think Wait son Was this the conversation where England wanted us to
9:36
go into Munich and then it became Russia going into Munich was that what this was
9:42
yeah Initially England wanted to support us into Munich and then from there that
9:49
we would help the English kick out Berlin But what we thought that we
9:55
thought that would fail because once we get into Munich Munich would retreat to Tyolia and then we would be dislodged
10:02
again and then thus it would like cut off support and then like the English attack on the Berlin would fail So
10:09
that's like why we said no But then Jessica got Russia in the talks and then
10:16
Jessica Oh I remember this Jessica like lowkey threatened us We were like why should like we give support into Munich
10:23
and she's like oh it's because we have um fleets in the Irish and English channel and we're like oh like that like
10:31
made me like start questioning the English but I think now it's okay Yeah
10:37
Like what we were talking about before with like the whole journey thing and like when it was divided we didn't benefit too much I feel like it really
10:45
came to like a head here because what we were saying to Jessica is like well why would we why like why would we do this
10:51
and like Sean was saying like she was basically just like well if you don't then we will take you out of the game is
10:59
essentially what she said and we were like oh that's not good
11:04
So it wasn't really your choice you felt forced to do it
11:10
Yeah I guess a little Yeah
11:15
but I think we would rather have like we would rather have the Russians control
11:21
Munich rather than Austria Austrians Yeah Otherwise Munich could like tap
11:27
Burgundy if we needed it to take Marseilles Yeah Okay that's good That's a smart
11:33
smart idea So here you decided to retreat to Paris
11:39
and an army was built by English uh by the English What do you think about that
11:48
i think we might have suggested that or like we both thought that at the same time We were encouraging them to make a
11:56
land incursion because somehow I don't even know why they put the army in
12:03
Finland But we thought like to help them like to still like cooperate with them
12:08
it would be good to suggest like good ideas And like if I were the English I would also build an army to like start
12:14
making inlands into mainland Europe So in your opinion do you think Sorry keep
12:22
continue Oh I'm good Yeah Okay In your opinion do you consider fleets by
12:28
England or armies by England a bigger threat to you
12:35
m like either fleets or armies a bigger
12:41
threat Yes I think right now we're a little bit concerned with the fleet
12:46
specifically in like like the English Channel and what is that like the Irish Sea Yeah So I I guess I would say fleets
12:56
just because Yeah Like Yeah specifically if they like gone to like MAO or anything like that
13:02
Yeah Then they could like strike three centers from one scene Yeah What is it
13:07
do you think that's stopping the English from just completely invading that space
13:16
i think it's our like openness and like willingness to work with them to repel
13:21
the Russians and Austrians But like if I was the English
13:27
I'd probably invade because like that's like a really good opportunity Like we completely left the Mid-Atlantic All it
13:34
takes is one They could have moved English Channel into Brass and the Irish Sea into
13:40
Mid-Atlantic If I was the English I would do it But and I honestly think
13:45
that they will really soon I think like either like the last time or the last
13:51
last time that we spoke to them we or at least I was like super concerned about that and so I I asked them like okay
13:58
well why won't you because like logically if they should then why wouldn't they and like I don't know
14:04
their explanation was just like odd So I think that is where their heads are at and I think that's what they will be
14:11
doing very soon Do you think that you'll be able to successfully repel it if you
14:17
see it coming i don't know Oh Lena I was talking with
14:24
like Od today and he was also talking with the Austrians He's thinking of a way to
14:30
like I forgot what's the current map like to kick them out of Holland and for
14:37
us to start protecting ourselves in the Mid-Atlantic there Yeah So okay Well I I'm also like not sure at
14:45
the moment because right now the Italians are in retreat and like Yeah So
14:50
I don't know Well we'll get there very soon And actually that that does that I will be asking a very important question
14:56
on that in the future as well Moving on to the next phase You finally get Marseilles back What a journey that was
15:03
It took how many years like two three years Incredible Bravo Good job for
15:10
sticking it out guys But now that you have taken it back
15:15
do you what do you think about Italy so far now that they're kind
15:21
of now that the roles have sort of reversed yeah this was the most interesting year
15:28
because the Austrians like finally came to us for help because
15:34
um Bul Romania was taken Bulgaria was taken and Munich was taken So they
15:41
finally came to us for help and this is the first time that Italy was like willing to talk to us But their plan was
15:48
like ass Like they wanted us to retreat either their fleet in Leon or North
15:54
Africa while they hold everything else Like why do we like lose a turn while
15:59
they get to hold and then at 3:19 like not even a minute before the deadline
16:05
Mac was like you know what I'm going to move Tuskany into Leon with the reason that it would bounce out I guess that
16:11
makes sense but like you don't do stuff like that at like 39 45 seconds before Yeah Or you were going to Were you going
16:19
to follow through on your promise if they didn't do that
16:24
i don't know because like we had the upper hand here We could take Marseilles back So like like why wouldn't we like
16:32
they've persisted for what year is this for five years Like why why should we
16:38
wait our turn instead of just like going in when we have the upper hand finally
16:43
so this English move into Belgium correct me if I'm wrong but this
16:48
was something that you wanted them to do Yeah I think it's very surprising and very
16:56
interesting that you have that level of trust with them when you have not always been on good terms with England It has
17:02
been a rocky relationship What What made you think that they were being honest here and
17:07
that they were going to give it back to you
17:12
actually don't know what I was thinking at that time After that move when they got into Belgium
17:21
then I don't know I just call it a leap of faith I guess I don't know Yeah I
17:26
would agree I mean I guess looking back on it seems kind of dumb but at the time it didn't feel like a massive risk for
17:34
some reason I don't know It's very interesting Moving on into the next
17:41
phase Now there's a couple of interesting things happening here Uh how about we start with what's
17:48
happening here italy got TYS into Western Mediterranean and they failed to
17:54
take back Parseay Well you successfully got into Belgium Everything seems to be going perfect here Uh what are your
18:02
negotiations with Italy looking like at this point of the game
18:09
i think it stopped for this turn actually We were actually talking with the Austrians and Russians actually for
18:17
this turn Are you worried at all that the Austrians and Russians seem to have made
18:24
peace over here oh I'm
18:29
not I'm not too worried about the Russians the Austrians they're
18:36
like the Russians have like complete like leverage over the Austrians and the
18:43
Russia also kind of needs Austria to kick uh England out of the mainland
18:49
Europe That was actually like really funny this turn because
18:55
um we had to get Holland to support us into Belgium instead of using North Sea
19:02
otherwise that plan would fail So like we secretly helped the Austrians and
19:08
Russians to take Keel but we did it in a way that like that we weren't involved
19:15
Yeah Very So yeah because Holland could
19:21
support Ke to hold but because it supported you it couldn't do that Yeah that was kind of Yeah that was smart
19:28
That's good That's That's good That's That's good gameplay
19:34
Uh yeah So I I assume that means that you are still worried about the English
19:40
Yeah And we were talking about this where we don't want the English to
19:46
really know how concerned we are about them because if they see us being aggressive they will we all know they
19:54
can take us out So like they will like push the trigger on that like detonator and so we just kind of need to like
20:00
slowly and subtly start protecting ourselves instead of like boom like you
20:05
know what I mean do you think so i think that was part of this Do you think you'll be better able to achieve this if
20:11
your war with Italy stops sooner rather than later
20:17
Yeah Mac was like talking to me earlier and she's like I was going to tell Alena
20:22
about this but she proposed having Leon and Wes demilitarized and that no fleets
20:29
enter there Like like me personally I don't think we should take that like we should like
20:36
like because we have the upper hand right we have like three fleets another fleet on the way and we could like
20:43
probably like easily take their main land Yeah I agree I feel like that's
20:49
she's saying that at a time when it's convenient for Italy and we've kind of been asking for peace for quite a while
20:56
now So I don't know why we should start now Are you sure okay All right Why do you think taking Why do you think taking
21:04
Italy's mainland will be an easy one there's a lot of Yeah there's a lot of territory to cover Are you sure that it
21:10
will be fast enough for you guys and it will be easy enough for you guys as you think it will be
21:16
that's true too I guess but also I think Russia will
21:24
convince Austria to go after Italy because they have leverage over them
21:29
because Italy will be like the reason why the English could potentially win I
21:34
mean especially earlier because we have to defend ourselves from the English but
21:40
we can't defend ourselves because we're so preoccupied with Italy which means English could grab a lot more centers
21:47
from us if they like wanted to Yeah Well that's why everyone wants to see like
21:52
Italy gone You did decide to build a fleet and breast This does you did mention that this was supposed to be
21:58
used against Italy but it's also a countermeasure against England Am I
22:03
wrong or right you are right
22:09
Initially wait no Okay everybody talked there at
22:14
the same time Sean can you go first oh uh initially it was built for Italy
22:21
but with what Obay proposed it might be used for the English later on but we're
22:27
not sure yet So here's the other thing
22:33
Uh just tactics wise if you're going to continue attacking Italy how are you going to do it in a way that is fast
22:40
enough to keep up with the board
22:47
leaders i don't know I don't really think the like those three other powers
22:54
will like grow to like 12 or like 14 centers
22:59
because they're always like constantly like backstabbing each other Like once one of them gets too powerful the others
23:05
start backstabbing them Though I think Russia could potentially like they could
23:11
like take Austria rather easily now So I think maybe those that would be like the
23:17
only threat So if Russia starts if Russia's going to take Austria
23:23
then how do you how are you going to how are you going to like counter that if you just let him take
23:31
Austria you can't you can't you can't really do anything about that yourself Do you think that you could convince
23:37
Italy to maybe help the Austrians out against the Russians
23:45
i don't know Okay
23:51
I mean I think the Italians and the Austrians like have like a long alliance so I think hopefully they would be able
23:58
to convince each other I don't know if we really would be able to do that
24:03
convincing cuz I know that like yeah Mac doesn't really like negotiating with us
24:09
though Well she did propose a demilitarized zone in Leon and Western Mediterranean That is true If if you
24:16
were to take her up on that offer these fleets would be free to perhaps go
24:22
against the English if you wanted that instead Is that something that you think is worth it at all or do you not even
24:30
want to consider that possibility
24:37
not sure yet The only like fleets that could be used for England like without giving them too much warning would be
24:44
the south coast of Spain and the fleet in Brass Because if like we demilitarize and then we start
24:52
moving our fleets back up I think that could be seen as like a warning sign for the English and they could move faster
24:59
than us Yeah Well do you think
25:05
that who I mean like obviously in order to win you need
25:12
to make sure that the biggest threats in the game do not get the upper hand Who
25:17
do you think is the biggest threat in this game right now
25:25
i mean maybe currently Russia Yeah
25:32
because we saw like last turn or last last turn or whatever they got into
25:37
Bulgaria and they could do that again right now but they're playing nice with the Austrians to hold back the English
25:45
So I think that Austria could fall quite easily Mhm
25:54
Do you think that the Do you think that the English will will stab you soon like how soon would
26:01
they stab you if they are going to right now
26:07
i don't know because like we also offered help with our army in Belgium to
26:13
like keep cooperating with them for now But it could odd was mentioning that
26:19
Belgium could also be used for a stab and that the Russians could support us into Holland But
26:26
like I think we're still on good terms with the English because they kind of need us right now to get back into
26:33
Europe Yeah I feel like we have probably like another year or so but we just need
26:40
to be like a little bit cautious Would your would you eventually
26:47
let England stab you or would you make the first move how would you
27:00
respond i don't know I think next turn will determine if we're going to defend
27:08
ourselves first or
27:19
If so there is I think there is a balance between taking more Italian
27:27
centers and letting them fight against Russia What do you think that balance
27:32
would be if there is one to strike
27:39
could you say that again sorry I think that Italy has the ca the
27:45
capacity to go against Russia and make their life harder especially down in
27:51
Turkey But do you think you would want to balance that possibility with the
27:58
chance of taking more Italian centers how would you do that
28:11
i think maybe it would require the fleet in Tunisia to stay
28:20
there And then the fleets in West and TYS to also move to move uh east into
28:28
like Greece and Trieste to provide a sort of buffer zone against the Russians
28:35
for us at least But I don't know That's what I could
28:40
brainstorm So what's the most important thing for
28:47
you to do moving forward
28:56
right now we need to make a big choice to either like start going for the
29:01
English or go after Italy's um land Yeah
29:06
What about the What about Okay I think there's a third possibility that you are sort of
29:13
neglecting and that would be going against Russia right now What are your thoughts on that idea
29:30
i don't see how we could You would be moving your armies towards this center
29:35
area Oh we still kind of need the army and gas I
29:43
see you think it's too inconvenient to attack Russia right now which is perfectly fine That's a perfectly valid
29:50
interpretation So the issue comes down to attack the English or continue
29:55
attacking Italy Yeah Yeah So so what is continuing go
30:03
ahead Go ahead Go ahead Well do you think continuing to attack Italy will
30:08
make you um let's say let's say your attack on Italy is successful Do you think by then
30:17
that the board state will be too late for you to um recover or to stand up to the other
30:25
powers
30:34
per chance But like I'm okay with like well me personally I'm okay with like getting second Like I'd like I'd like to
30:42
see this game end before school ends I guess
30:48
we could try and continue it if if there is a will to continue it after school
30:53
When there is a will there is a way the So I think that's actually very
31:01
interesting because there is no second place in this game Sean There's only one
31:06
winner and everybody else is a loser
31:11
They're losers What do you call second place in your book
31:17
uh the first to lose That's Abby Lee Miller
31:28
Yeah Uh for me it means like the second most centers I guess
31:36
I see But you're you obviously want the win bore I'm assuming right yeah But
31:44
it's just hard for us to do that now Never say never There is always this
31:51
possibility that you can win And if you continue if you continue to attack the
31:56
board at large with the tenacity that you have shown fending off Italy then
32:03
there is a chance Never give up I'm telling you
32:11
So let's see I think we've covered most of everything Ernest do you have any
32:17
other questions left for our friends here well I had a remark I noticed that Elena didn't have to go after a while
32:24
Yeah I like lost track of time and at this point I'll just be a little late I'm so sorry Alena Oh no you're fine Do
32:32
you guys have any questions for us i don't Nope
32:40
All right All right I wish you luck in your momentous decision You even though
32:47
you have the least amount of centers Actually no Italy has the least amount of centers You have the second least
32:52
amount of centers You guys do have a very important position to play in this game
32:59
Your choice will strengthen regardless of what you choose to do You will be strengthening somebody
33:06
else at the expense of another party
33:11
And that's just something you need to really think smart about depending on what you do you could help somebody win
33:18
that you don't want to win because you want to win yourselves So it's it is a very important decision Sean I'm glad
33:25
that you have recognized that and I hope you guys choose the best what decision that you choose Well
33:34
thank you Thank you so much for taking Thank you so much for taking the time to do this Of course Of course Time
