0:00
i guess let's get straight to business now so this is where we left off and before
0:07
i get into specific questions i actually kind of want to ask like oh
0:15
crap what was i going to ask i was going to ask like how would you describe like this
0:23
last these last few uh weeks of diplomacy
0:29
tragic i think certainly tragic
0:35
tragic or um dramatic
0:41
yeah like i was honestly a little
0:47
unexpected you know i was i wanted i wish we
0:54
we pulled through at the end
1:00
i see but even even though you couldn't do that do you think that after
1:05
everything it was all worth it in the end oh yeah yeah the experience was
1:10
worth it absolutely mhm all right all right on to specific questions here so
1:19
you know i won't fault you for not remembering this because this was i think two weeks ago so uh do not feel
1:26
any sort of how am i supposed to say it any sort of like
1:32
guilt shame or guilt that you don't remember but this is where we left off
1:38
and i was wondering like why did you decide to continue
1:46
to have peaceful relationship with the russians here when you could have tried
1:52
and maybe advanced into galia get a position that was better for taking back more
1:58
centers or was there some reason why you didn't do that
2:03
um i think at this point we low-key got manipulated by russia like of course
2:09
like we did agree like okay let's have peaceful relations but also i think it's
2:14
cuz like we were in our minds like we were the most afraid of england at the at that time so we were like "okay we're
2:22
going to go along with russia and help them take england down and help them
2:27
like weaken england or france or something like that so that we can just like fight till the end with russia but
2:36
get england out of the way." i think that was our mindset and so that's why we like helped them at the time which
2:41
proved to be a mistake but yeah yeah i agree how do you you mentioned the
2:48
russians manipulated you how do you how did they achieve this what did they do i
2:54
mean i think most of most of the past you whatever
3:00
um has just been bouncing back and forth between fearing russia and fearing england based on whoever had the most so
3:06
i think they tapped into our fear for england um especially because we had had
3:13
some less than friendly relations with jessica and amber um i would
3:22
say neutral at best aggressive at worst especially with amber
3:29
um but yeah that's pretty much i think how they were able to convince us to
3:34
work with them because it was mutually beneficial for us to attack them
3:41
it was also this turn that the italians and the french seemed to have been
3:47
almost like ceasing their attacks on each other how do you feel about that
3:54
we we actually worked very hard to create this like neutral neutralization
4:00
pact between italy and france because like like we said like we were trying to take england down and so to do that we
4:07
were like "okay we need france to like a stronghold against england." and we can't do that if italy and france are
4:14
attacking each other so then we tried to convince the italians because the italians were like our closest allies we
4:21
were like "okay italians don't attack them." and it took a lot of like convincing for them to be like "okay we
4:28
won't." and then for the f for yeah for the french to also agree and say okay yeah we're we're going to not attack
4:35
each other for the benefit of taking down england mhm the so if italy is not
4:43
going to attack france what are they going to do in order to gain centers
4:52
that's the concern no we had a plan with them they said they told us that they were going very south through ionian um
5:00
to attack russia which we hoped they would that was the plan um and honestly
5:08
we thought it was worth it because we trusted them and we knew that france was truly fearing england and they needed to
5:14
fight back so we thought if england and sorry wait
5:20
excuse me if france and italy uh really were setting up a truce there then it
5:28
would mean that france could successfully push back against england and then italy could help us attack
5:36
russia we'll see how that works out in the next few phases yes we will yes we
5:42
will so here russia takes bulgaria and was this a move that you
5:51
expected or was it completely unexpected no it was definitely it was partially
5:57
expected because as you can see we supported bulgaria from serbia but there
6:02
wasn't that much we could do obviously um so we just did what we could but it
6:08
wasn't enough okay so there's a couple of other interesting things here um
6:17
you sort of you sort of mentioned that italy was supposed to move against russia right here but they didn't was
6:24
that like something you didn't know was coming or did you know that they were going to hold for a bit to make sure
6:31
france didn't do anything sneaky honestly i don't remember what happened
6:38
there i think they i don't think they told us though
6:43
that they were going to hold there um and i think they had previously
6:48
told us they were going to move in and then failed to do that so i don't remember very well but that's what i
6:54
think and yeah do you have anything specific that pops out to you this phase
7:02
of the game
7:08
let's see um well england was lowkey
7:14
like succeeding mhm and so it just it only made it more
7:20
like pressuring for us and like i think the yeah the whole thing was that the
7:25
whole time we were trying to decide like should we betray italy at this point i think we were like at this point should
7:32
we just betray them and like start to take their territories because like you said like they weren't really gaining
7:38
centers and and um they were they were pretty much just like every most of the
7:43
rounds they would be like oh we have to play defense this round like we have to play defense and so like most of the
7:50
time they were playing defense and so they weren't really even going after anything and so we were like okay is
7:56
this the point where we should like start going after them even though like
8:02
you know we made an alliance or whatever like if they're not getting any gain
8:07
from what their position is right now then is it time for us to like go in for
8:12
the go in for the goals you know mhm exactly
8:19
how how did you feel about i mean i mean i guess it's pretty obvious but how did you feel about england doing well here
8:26
bad fearful yes all of the above we didn't like it
8:32
we weren't ready for it but i think we still would rather or at least i felt
8:38
like it was better for england to be in charge than russia just because england is further from us um and we kept since
8:48
the start we were hoping that england would annoy and attack russia up top but
8:54
they freaking didn't which is annoying so yeah all right moving on to the next
9:02
phase uh nothing too important here but england builds two armies i
9:08
mean let me just let me just hear your thoughts on that cuz why not
9:15
i mean scared me they were just like i don't
9:20
know at that point i felt like what are what can we do to like stop them because
9:25
um also the thing was that ove was he was gunning for the english but
9:33
at the same time he was trying to get us to like go for italy like the whole time cuz he was like you need to weaken them
9:40
like there's no way that we're going to take down england right now and that that's like another part of his manipulation tactics but yeah he kind of
9:47
was saying like okay england is not the primary target right now and i think that's what helped him or helped england
9:54
kind of like gain as much traction as they did was just like us not being
10:00
clear about like what our goals were with like attacking or like trying to target somebody like it wasn't clear so
10:08
they just could like slip in through the cracks and like get more and more um
10:13
gain more and more while we were just still trying to like figure out what we're doing mhm
10:20
while we're on the topic i am fascinated with your relationship with russia cuz
10:26
like i mean just last turn they took bulgaria and you said it was against
10:31
your consent but here are you still planning to work with them here even though they
10:37
have repeatedly shown that they see dot and take dot
10:43
well um like yeah i feel like we fell for
10:51
their ps way too much cuz i think after i don't remember if it was this round
10:58
but it was one round where russia like took one of our territories and it wasn't really part of the plan but then
11:05
but then immediately he was like "no no no no like i'll give you back one and then and then like we can do this new
11:12
plan that he came up with um and i think we kind of fell for that cuz we were
11:18
like okay like he'll give us one back as as a means of gaining our trust and then
11:24
we'll go along with his other plan that will work towards like taking somebody else down
11:31
mhm do you think that i mean like with your with your uh
11:40
with your with now that you have more experience do you think that it is more worth it for you to come up with
11:47
your own plans instead of following your allies with quotation marks plans
11:55
yeah i think so all right moving on to the next phase
12:00
here couple interesting things but first things
12:07
first it looks like you're buddy buddy again with russia
12:13
yeah we never learn our lesson i guess such a such an abusive relationship i
12:20
know literally it's like it's like they were like using and abusing us and we were just like no no no no no it's not
12:25
that they kept tricking us over and over it's that we had no choice but to work with them yeah no that's the thing that's the thing that's why it's abusive
12:31
though cuz we couldn't escape the cycle exactly exactly well do you think there's an argument to
12:36
be made that you could have helped england and escape the cycle that way
12:43
yeah but like we didn't want to do that i guess and that's the thing it just it literally just kept flip-flopping between england's on top russian on top
12:49
england's on top russia's on top so it would have just been like what's the point you know because we would have helped england and then they would have
12:55
been the strongest and they would have been threatening us you know if you helped england maybe you could have
13:00
helped yourself to more russian centers before they got them but we'll never know now we could have but i don't think
13:07
it would be like russia 10 versus us six i don't think it would have been enough you know and england we really really
13:14
really tried to do that trust me but england was just extremely difficult to work
13:21
with they were against long-term alliances they were against
13:27
cooperation so that or at least one part of england was no both parts both parts
13:33
really and i want them to watch this and hear me say this both parts were extremely difficult so yeah we tried um
13:42
we could have won that way but yeah so the other interesting thing italy held all units here how do you feel about
13:49
that that's when they forgot to submit orders right
13:55
yep yeah i mean obviously a bad move
14:03
um duh but i mean at this point i'm not sure if there's much they could have
14:09
done i guess i don't know what they were planning honestly our our communication
14:14
with them broke down a little bit near the end yeah um we wish they would we wish
14:22
they would have done their promise and move towards russia and moved towards france but that's it is what it
14:30
is all right let's move on to the next phase where looks like italy does follow
14:37
through on that promise but it's kind of too late russia has moved to protect his
14:43
territory exactly now i'mma i'mma ask a question but as
14:50
i'm asking it i'm going to predict what you say okay russia took your budapest home center
14:58
was that something you expected to happen and i'm going to guess no
15:04
no yeah obviously not obviously not yeah
15:13
well i mean like i i think we'll both feel like broken records if i ask this question
15:19
but just like was this the point where you realized "fick russia dude."
15:27
yes yes this was i think this was when abe started being like "yay we're having a
15:34
steak dinner tonight aren't we?" because he knew that he couldn't i could there was no way he was going to get me
15:39
to actually be on his side and all all the working that i was doing with him was purely out of necessity so
15:48
yeah that's that it is a shame at least you got munich
15:53
back though that was good but i don't know you could
16:00
have well do you think all right now that you know that this is what now that
16:05
you know how the game has ended and like what has happened would you have
16:12
considered trying to support england into berlin here um maybe i think that's what they were
16:18
trying to get us to do right i think so yeah like for one of the one of the last
16:23
rounds like they were like "okay let's do this big thing you help us into here and then you gain this and then we can
16:31
both weaken russia and you guys gain like a center or two or something like
16:36
that and so we can mutually um gain centers and also weaken russia but i
16:41
think at that point we were like we had our own move in mind that we thought was going to produce a better result and so
16:48
we were like no like no we're just going to like do our own thing but i think we should have done that a little earlier
16:54
cuz by that time like using our own plan or whatever it wasn't it wasn't like
16:59
strong we weren't strong enough at that point to like get it to succeed the way we wanted it to so i think maybe we
17:05
should have considered more like helping england and then maybe gaining a center or two um and then use our own like
17:12
thoughtout plans earlier in the game
17:18
all right moving oh on the opposite side of the board looks like france has a lucky
17:25
streak here he successfully takes back breast and england moves out of belgium
17:30
meaning that they don't capture it how do you feel about that it's good
17:37
i mean we like it when when the big guys get a little bit smaller um at this
17:43
point we were try we've always been tried to be friendly with friends but they're always like distrust us um but
17:50
we were at least glad to see them succeed a little bit because their their win is our win so yeah it
17:57
was it was good moving on to the next phase
18:03
um i believe it was around no actually it was next year never
18:10
mind well i think correct me if i'm wrong but is the observation that it was
18:19
around this time that communications broke down and it became a game of move
18:25
your units collect more dots get more territory i'm not even talking to you did communications break down in general
18:32
here yeah this is like when things started i mean we were just busy with like whatever graduation and like it was
18:40
like the final week of school and all that so i think that at this point in time there's like so much going on that
18:46
it was hard to coordinate a lot of stuff um so it was kind of just like do whatever um yeah i don't think we talked
18:54
very much with anyone in this round we kind of just wanted to move and acquire as much territory as we could
19:01
interesting uh that being said what do you what would you say is the most
19:07
interesting thing that's happening on this board
19:14
um i think the italian move into russia right now because that's a little
19:19
bit i think it's quite bold for them to do two whole fleets in the aian sea and
19:25
in uh is that eastern sea yeah eastern mediterranean mhm yeah um obviously
19:31
russia predicts it a little bit but i mean i really wonder what their plan was i think they were going to go for
19:38
um smy together i think that's that's cool that's
19:44
interesting and obviously i think their communications with france went well because they both left their centers
19:52
wide open so i'm guessing they trust each other now yeah and also three of our orders like
20:00
failing that's interesting in a bad way
20:06
you mean the move orders yes okay moving on to the next
20:15
phase so well this is actually all right this
20:20
is a little bit of an unorthodox thing for me to question but in this in this
20:27
move set there were like two specific orders like two specific convoys that
20:33
ove really liked it tickled his fancy you could say
20:39
um how how do you feel about those orders was that something you were expecting or do you think it's strategic
20:45
genius or anything like that
20:50
um are you wait are you talking about the they're both convoy orders the
20:55
breast to liverpool and the denmark to leavonia order yeah i mean yeah i think they are really
21:02
interesting i like the i like the breast to liverpool i think that tickles my fancy as well because it's hurting
21:09
england um and then the denmark to
21:14
lvn i'm not sure why what do you mean you're saying ove liked that od thought
21:21
it was really really uh it's basically genius he was like he wasn't expecting
21:26
it is what he said i think they were planning that for a long time so yeah they were they were it was a a move of
21:33
strategic genius yeah i think it was like for for for i don't know maybe like two weeks before this england had
21:42
constantly been saying that they want to move in like into that territory
21:47
eventually once russia had their guard down which i think they successfully did here
21:54
all right so well strategically speaking how do you feel about your moves uh with
22:01
against russia here um it's nice that we eliminated bulgaria
22:09
obviously strategically i'm happy with that and we got budapest too um so i was
22:15
starting to feel kind of good here except for the fact that vienna was gone but
22:21
um yeah i think this round we felt better than we felt worse you know well
22:26
i think the tragic thing with vienna is you could have stopped it trieste was holding and doing nothing and you could
22:32
have supported tyran to vienna that was a blunder on my part
22:39
well like you said this was the era of no communication but if i if i remember
22:47
correctly something interesting did happen in the spring of 1910
22:53
this was the phase that you were told the game would end when school ended
23:00
and it was at this point that russia was in the lead with 11 centers
23:05
was there any colluding with other powers to put russia in its place to
23:10
make sure that you could even shoot for the win or just knock him down a peg
23:16
honestly at this point i think i don't even know if i talked to anyone at this round i think i was just like yeah i
23:23
just saw that big line all the way across the map and i was like what the hell is going on we're not going to win this you know
23:31
so on at least on our part there wasn't any serious sort of plotting or
23:37
collusion although we would have i think selena and i agreed we would have liked to see england win over russia
23:44
yeah i was i was like at this point i was like there's no way we're going to win and so i was like plotting with
23:51
jessica a little bit i was like "how do we how can you get us to the most centers as possible and get russia like
23:58
down as much as possible?" but i think like what i think i proposed um i don't
24:04
know launching full scale against russia and then us taking like finally kind of
24:11
taking ital the italian territories but then i think it just fell through cuz she she was like "no like first of all i
24:19
have to talk about this with amber and second of all like i don't know if that's a good idea cuz we need to focus
24:24
on our our our stuff." and yeah so it kind of just fell through and it never
24:30
happened but i wish it did cuz then maybe we could have held stronger at the end
24:35
it's funny that you mentioned england because in their last interview they mentioned how they were trying so so
24:41
hard on a specific finals day where you guys shared a class to like get a deal
24:47
achieved to get it done but it just didn't work out how was that on your end
24:53
oh i know what she's talking about that day that day she was so she
25:01
was so like she was like tell me exactly what you want and and if you don't then
25:07
we're not going to do this and we were like i don't do you remember that day yeah i'll be
25:13
honest at that point i kind of just wanted to mess with her i was just like she kept being i don't understand what
25:19
you're requesting tell us exactly what you need or else we're not going to work with you do you want us to work with you or not and i was just like i don't we're
25:26
i there's no way we're going to win this so i just kind of wanted to like troll her a little bit um i think it worked
25:34
yeah no cuz she was like "tell me exactly what you want i don't understand what you're asking us to do and if you
25:39
don't tell us and we're not going to do it." okay yes um but then we were like "uh yeah my mom just told me i'm being
25:46
too loud sorry." yeah so then we were just i think at at that point we were just kind
25:51
of like it was kind of funny cuz she was like "tell me exactly what you and then
25:57
we weren't really telling her what we wanted cuz i don't really think we knew what we wanted no yeah i i had no real
26:02
plan but i was acting like i did which really really annoyed her yeah it was kind of funny the well if you wanted
26:09
england to win i think that was the time to like try and organize something like maybe a support attack into munich or
26:18
something like that honestly no no no honestly i disagree with gabriel's
26:23
statement before i actually liked seeing russia win over england
26:30
really mhm interesting that's funny seline cuz
26:35
there is a specific moment in these interviews where i think it i think it was either it was either you or amber i
26:43
forget that was like that would that said something like if if ove wins this game i'm going to be so pissed right
26:49
that was amber tell us amber okay no i i'm actually i think obey is the
26:56
pinnacle of the game of diplom he is like the spokesperson of the game of
27:01
diplomacy i feel like he embodies the spirit of this game i think he's the best diplomat out of all of us a scammer
27:09
not amber amber's the worst diplomat let me just tell you amber if you're watching this amber if you're watching
27:15
this you're the worst at this literally no matter what we would say we would try we'd literally come up to her and like beg her to like make a deal we were like
27:22
"we'll do anything you want." she's like "why no what is my no why would i do that gabriel?" and she was like "no matter no matter what we wanted she was
27:29
extremely confrontational always." so yeah she's the worst diplomat so you
27:35
don't know what if it was part of the english strategy the good cop bad cop energy you know but that's the thing the
27:41
bad cop accomplished nothing she was literally because we she would literally just be rude to us and then we'd be like "okay whatever." and then go talk to
27:47
jessica and actually work out a deal and so yeah you mentioned at this point
27:53
i mean like at this point you don't think you're going to win you don't think you have a chance so why not march
27:59
your troops into venice and just be an [ __ ] get as much centers as you
28:05
can like italian territory why not try and take that now
28:12
i don't know old habits die hard i suppose yeah i think we were just like you know it's kind of tacky to betray
28:19
them at this point if we're not even going to win you know we were like yeah so we were just like okay maybe i should
28:26
maybe i should have made maybe i should have tried to formulate an incentive like the more centers you have the
28:32
better that way it would encourage that high stakes who betrays who kind of
28:37
energy yeah no i i kind of wish we did betray them no offense hey if you guys are watching this we did not betray you
28:44
but maybe we should have so the other thing is that italy also
28:51
failed to provide orders here i'm guessing that wasn't a very proud
28:57
moment for you guys either you didn't like that no yeah uh i have i have an
29:03
interview with them scheduled later for today and i'll figure out whether or not that was an accident they just lost interest in the game or it was on
29:09
purpose but but here going on into the next phase i think a very interesting thing
29:16
happens uh russia manages to snag the
29:21
victory and there's a couple of really interesting things that happen here so much is going on here yeah first off we
29:28
got that we got the map art that smyrna is doing again
29:33
um two of the english home centers have been taken by france so hey i guess your
29:39
peace deals with italy did achieve something um russia successfully manages to take
29:47
back not successfully manages to take back berlin successfully manages to take back rum successfully manages to take
29:55
b and they successfully defend against two units with one unit i can't believe this
30:01
i can't believe that happened yeah this yeah this time i didn't even i
30:09
don't think we knew when the orders were due i don't think we knew what anyone was doing obviously we've submitted zero
30:15
orders we could have easily prevented some deaths but we
30:21
didn't so so i think that's fascinating too and i almost forgot that you didn't
30:26
submit any orders did you choose not to submit or was it just a passing thing
30:32
that you i think it was just like wasn't this on finals day this was friday this last day i think there was just so much
30:38
other stuff going on that we like it slipped our mind it wasn't a purposeful move
30:45
[Music] do you regret that yes i don't i don't i
30:51
regret it i regret it i do not cuz i hate i hate losing and when i saw that
30:57
final thing where it was like we we got lower than france i was like "oh hell no
31:04
can't believe this happened." and i was kind of pissed a little bit at myself but hey it is i i think i'd like playing
31:12
a game with you seline especially when i win cuz i'd love that reaction no i hate
31:17
losing i hate losing i don't i don't hate it as much and i'm i don't mind that we got last place i don't really
31:22
care i care a little bit more the other the other thing is italy takes greece
31:28
which i think is just so hilarious that was funny when i saw that on the map i was like "okay well played."
31:35
i mean what else you got to do right mhm and now we arrive at the final stage
31:42
with you unfortunately being dead last italy beating you with five centers
31:48
don't remind us i mean yeah as you know it was quite
31:53
easily avoidable we just didn't avoid it hey we're not dead last turkey turkey
32:00
and germany are below us true so
32:06
now you have reached the end mhm if you were to start all over this game
32:14
with the same people in the same countries what would you do differently
32:21
we would have never done a an a round where we do no moves um we would have
32:27
been much more aware of support holds we would have been more aware of the rules
32:33
because there was a few rounds where we submitted uh incorrect order um those
32:39
are the basics obviously i think we would
32:45
have no offense picked more um cunning allies
32:52
yeah oh i yes i agree with that i also think
32:59
that i don't think next time i don't know if i would have like an ally
33:04
throughout the whole game like we did this time cuz i think it really did slow
33:10
us down in some ways because at certain points we really could have just gone
33:15
for them or we could have like you know if if they were not our ally we we could have done this move or we could have
33:22
done that move or we could have helped another country like do a bigger
33:27
proposed move but a lot of like our alliance our very like strong
33:33
responsibility towards them stopped us from doing that a lot of times so i'd say maybe next time not have such a
33:40
strong strong alliance for the entire game and come up with like maybe like
33:46
propose more plans to the other nations instead of like listening to their plans and then following along with it like
33:53
make our like propose a plan to them so that we're the ones wielding the sword
34:00
mhm well i think you raised an interesting point seline having an ally
34:06
that lasts throughout the entire game can be a bad thing but it can also be a good thing in your case your ally with
34:14
your alliance with italy really helped you out in the beginning because you guys by not attacking each other managed
34:21
to do better in your respective fields but the longer that dragged on the more
34:27
you i mean i'm glad you guys began to realize this because it was true you began to realize that your alliance with
34:35
italy wasn't providing you much and it wasn't providing them much anyways either like at at that point yeah
34:43
there's no point in having an alliance at that point you're just too you're like the two friends that walk past each
34:49
other in the hall but don't really say hi you don't really great analogy
34:58
well if this game were to continue what do you think he would have
35:06
done those last few rounds we would have locked in kept talking to people kept making
35:13
plans kept moving defending wherever we could and then i think it would have been time
35:19
to you know got that friendship out of our life
35:24
but time time can only tell and that time is gone i think we would have gone
35:30
for italy in the coming rounds if we continued i would have i would have
35:36
wanted to go for italy and go for the turkish territories again try to reclaim
35:41
those and build more fleets i think the one thing that was like we definitely
35:46
were lacking and all the other countries had was that like every other nation had
35:51
fleets we had zero fleets so i think that was something that kind of hindered us as well mhm
35:59
let's say again that the game was going to continue do you think that russia would have eventually won or was there a
36:06
route for you england france or italy to win the game with 18 centers oh i think
36:14
england is quite likely i think they definitely could have won
36:19
um i hate to say but i don't think there was any way we were going to win and france and italy i think were also too
36:26
weak so yeah i don't know about france but maybe your assessment about you is correct france with seven centers may i
36:34
mean like france with seven centers they made a comeback i have to admit it was quite glorious
36:43
and who knows i wouldn't rule out a comeback for you either it's always possible i would never rule us out i
36:50
would say that if we kept on going maybe there's some world where we could have won
37:01
so after everything is said and done do you think that ove deserve to win this
37:08
game yes yeah i think so i have to say yes and
37:17
why is that because i mean he was the master
37:23
manipulator the the devilish diplomat you know
37:29
the perfect planner he he he had everything you know and i think i think
37:37
it says a lot that he was able to wield so many people at the same time
37:43
cuz he was like working with us the next round he was working with somebody else and even though we all kind of distrusted him he still got them to work
37:50
with him so and in the end it worked out so yeah i think he was he's worthy of
37:57
the title mhm
38:06
so when are you open to play diplomacy again guys
38:11
but seriously would you play this again is this oh for sure absolutely yes i
38:16
would play again i'm very i want to try playing it the classic way where it's just you sit down and bang it all out in
38:23
eight hours or whatever instead of like a very long drawn out thing cuz i did like this style but i also want to try
38:30
the normal style and see if i like that too
38:35
so you know what i agree and i'd love to play with you guys as well if you guys
38:40
are willing so i don't know maybe if maybe after all everyone's heads have cooled off everyone's burnout has kind
38:47
of subsided i'll just send a text into the weeple chat see if anyone's open for
38:53
round two irl eight hours god damn that'd be so long and that'd be so fun
38:58
too that would be i absolutely would love to do that yes i would too i don't
39:04
know if we would do teams though but speaking of which speaking of which by the way let's say theoretically you two
39:11
were not the same power that you control different ones how do you think your
39:16
relationship would like would how do you think it would be
39:23
no no no speaking cut off all ties okay i was going to say it depends on the uh
39:31
depends on joking what's it called depends on what countries we are our locations i think there's no way i think
39:38
that the fun part of this game is that anyone can be anything you know so we could be the greatest of allies or the
39:44
greatest of enemies what is this zootopia anyone can be anything
39:49
absolutely not no we saw it at moments we were dear allies with russia and at
39:54
moments we were dear i'm joking i'm joking i think it wouldn't i think we would just be the same except that if we
40:01
were like if we were like very much rival countries like if we were like a
40:06
russia england situation i think i would definitely be
40:12
very cautious and be like every move is calculated
40:18
go ahead gabriel i interrupted no that's i was just saying i agree that's it all right
40:25
well i have another question for you well obviously i have another question i have a question for you guys basically
40:32
um do you think what happened in this game is bound to repeat itself or that
40:38
this is only a unique outcome that that it was your actions through your
40:44
negotiations that produced this result
40:50
i think yeah i think this is a unique situation that was a product of all of
40:56
our moves and like negotiations because like like we know
41:02
diplomacy would not be a fair game if one country won every single time and as
41:08
we saw this time russia won but maybe next time like italy will win or like
41:13
some other country will win like we don't know we never know which which group or like country is going to win
41:19
and i think that speaks to the uniqueness of each game and like the
41:26
negotiations and moves made by everybody and how that changes the you know streak
41:33
of the game i agree well do you think what happened in this
41:38
game will influence what you will do in future games yes i think it's hard yeah cuz i think
41:45
know even if the obviously the countries and the locations are different you know people's personalities are still the
41:51
same so i think it will definitely provide some insight into how to play the game future i mean so i what i
41:59
gather from that answer is if you were neighbors with ove again you would not ally with them you would kill them
42:05
immediately yeah we would try to do it we honestly we probably would try to do basically
42:11
what we did now the same push you know but again probably wouldn't fail so yeah
42:22
what was the what was the move or the
42:29
moment in this game that you are most proud of
42:34
oh it was that one england betrayal where we got munich with russia and then
42:40
she just because that took some serious planning with russia uh yeah with russia and france and we were it was like not
42:47
100% going to work out because it just depended on if england bought our lie and they did and it was the most
42:52
satisfying thing of all time let's see what year was that exactly i need to see this that was the year after uh england
43:00
betrayed us oh and then immediately we backstabbed them
43:06
and that was great oh it was it this you helping to russian to kill cuz i don't think you ever got munich without
43:15
all right yeah it was that it was that cuz we had told it was that because we were just praying we were praying that
43:21
um the north sea was not going to do anything and we did this whole propaganda scheme to convince them that
43:28
france was going to attack so they should divert holland to support there and it worked and it was
43:37
awesome oh i oh i remember this actually yeah you're right it was russia you and
43:44
france working against england here russia um ove specifically called this
43:52
his masterpiece his masterpiece
43:58
our masterpiece ove or was it maybe you were just being manipulated no no
44:06
no no no no okay well what about you selene was this
44:14
also your favorite or was there something else yeah i think this was my also my
44:19
favorite it was just so delicious seeing the look of betrayal on jessica's face
44:25
he was like but you you what so confused
44:30
that's those are moments that i live for if i'm being honest that's what made me like this game also
44:38
wait i remember there was that one move that we did um it was against russia i forget
44:44
specifically what it was but i remember after we made it o was like "well played." and he gave us a little
44:50
handshake yes that was another one i forget i know i can tell he he loves the game so much that even if he gets
44:56
backstabbed if it's a smart move he'll he'll be happy he appreciates that that's me too i love adve for that yeah
45:03
exactly well we're nearing the end of this interview and with it the end of our
45:11
fun our fun journey into diplomacy with we the people but before we do end it do
45:18
you have any other questions for me
45:23
um what do you think was the the best move
45:31
well for me it was like there's a couple of things i love this game especially
45:38
because everybody was so committed to it it was surprising how committed everybody was and when that happens when
45:44
everybody is acting in their own self-interest it just becomes the best game ever
45:50
and i mean there is an online community for this and oftent
45:55
times that sort of commitment is not present there and so it loses a bit of its magic and you know stuff like that
46:04
but if i had my best my favorite interaction i think it's ought to be
46:10
what happens with belgium in the first few years of this game because it imperfectly encapsulates what i think
46:17
diplomacy like does magically first right germany supports france into
46:24
belgium england is mad as hell the next
46:30
season england supports germany into belgium france is mad as hell and you'll
46:36
never guess what happens in the next season because it's just you just wouldn't see it coming england gets into belgium with french support and germany
46:43
is mad like everyone's flip-fpping and it's just chaos incarnate it's so fun it
46:51
is if i had to but because that's over there and it's not over here i have to
46:57
say that another one of my favorite moves was was this one where england
47:05
supports russia into munich oh yeah but here here's the thing here's the thing
47:10
that i like a lot about this because it's your reaction that makes this move very fun for me because instead of
47:17
instead of well thanks instead of hating instead of hating russia who took munich
47:23
and who took rum you guys decided that it was all england's fault and you're going
47:30
to that's so silly it was
47:35
do you have any other questions for me my friends how how many games of diplomacy have you
47:42
played in your lifetime is it like tens hundreds thousands
47:47
millions
47:54
what why are you keeping it this mystery i don't know maybe it's
47:59
because i plan to play a future game with you and i think it's better if you don't know but hey we know you're good
48:05
we know you're good well okay if i'm being honest
48:12
um counting variants and all different modes i've probably played
48:19
around like 30 to 50 games
48:25
but that i mean like it's grant just just know it's not like something that i
48:31
do back to back to back like i do need breaks and i've gone like several months
48:36
without playing diplomacy sure and there are there are many ways to get better at this game there are many websites not
48:43
just this one there's there's like two other main big ones and
48:48
um like i mean there's more there's there's not as many press games meaning like
48:55
communication games a lot of games are no communication just like move your units that's a good way to really
49:02
increase how and not increase to improve your strategy and all that stuff basically i'm a nerd i've also played
49:08
several different variants that have different maps and different center layouts and all that stuff i've even
49:16
played a variant with 24 players wow it was like a world it was like a
49:21
world map the entire earth that's crazy
49:27
but yeah i haven't played in a while so i might be rusty i don't know but
49:35
this one was especially fun i wish i played in this game it would have been so cool would have been so great it
49:41
would have except you would have destroyed everyone yeah um yeah i know
49:49
yeah i
49:54
know if you have any more questions please fire them right now
50:02
do you think that you could have beat ove beat russia
50:08
i really i mean like i'm just shocked how how much ove got away with like just
50:14
i i think he deserves to win this game too because he managed to make everybody else look like a fool for not going
50:21
after them yeah i if i was in this game i would no matter where i was i would be
50:27
pressuring everybody to attack him we we i just want to say for anyone
50:32
watching this we have been we did that from the very beginning literally from the start we knew they were threat and
50:38
we tried to organize and nobody listened to us guess who won so
50:45
for the record does that does that instance of you like encouraging
50:50
everybody to attack russia give more credit to russia or
50:56
gives more negative credit to you guys how you guys failed versus how russia
51:02
managed to evade your your hostility it gives negative credit to everyone who
51:07
didn't listen to us that's what it g yeah it gives negative aura to everybody who ignored us mhm
51:14
it's funny that you see it that way any more questions guys funny that we see the truth
51:25
any more questions i think that's it for me
51:31
well i guess that's it then i guess that's it i'm very glad that you had fun
51:36
in this game even though you guys ended up falling from grace i think it tells i think it tells a story i think i'm you
51:42
see you're laughing even right now even though i said "hey you guys just lost." hey selene you just
51:51
lost but oh my god i can't you made the last few months of school really really fun you did we we literally you did
51:59
could not have done it without you for obvious reasons yes wait well okay i was
52:05
about to say a bunch of sentimental stuff in my goodbyes but i just thought of another question how much did
52:12
diplomacy take over your lives do you think that was like not a good thing did you get burnt out at all it didn't
52:19
really take over like our lives or my life at least i think that like we had
52:26
like a section of the day where it was diplomacy talk and then probably yeah we probably spent like half an hour every
52:32
night doing it yeah and then my favorite my favorite was when we just had a bunch of class time and everyone was in
52:38
involved and like we were all there i think i did get a little bit more burnt out when it was like text these people
52:45
text those people and it was kind of like just like a blob you know like
52:50
everything was happening like at once it's like very i don't know how to explain it but i i definitely really liked it when we were just all enjoying
52:58
it together in class very glad all right i think i'm out of
53:05
questions and i think you're out of questions so thank you again so so much for playing this game it's every player
53:11
that makes this game great and you are definitely one of those characters
53:18
the main character i don't know i mean like i don't know i mean i guess we could i
53:25
think we could make anyone the main character depending on how we edit it no
53:31
well also i i mean i think it's more likely for you guys cuz you do provide a lot of ammunition in these interviews
53:37
more so than other people i got to say what does that mean i mean like you say
53:43
the most interesting things like oh exactly exactly the most intellectual people come up with the most
53:49
intellectual thoughts may i just say all right selene okay
53:55
don't let your head get too big um my head is quite small
54:03
well thank you again i love you guys i hope we can play again in the future and
54:09
i hope we stay in touch yes i agree absolutely let's play this again sometime yes
54:16
all right bye guys bye bye
